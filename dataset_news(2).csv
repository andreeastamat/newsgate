"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/us/politics/trump-biden-protests-polling.html"/How Trump and the Black Lives Matter Movement Changed White Voters’ Minds/"A majority of American voters support the demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice that have roiled the country over the past month, embracing ideas about bias within the criminal justice system and the persistence of systemic racism that are central tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement, according to a new national poll of registered voters by The New York Times and Siena College.

Fifty-nine percent of voters, including 52 percent of white voters, believe the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis was “part of a broader pattern of excessive police violence toward African Americans,” the poll found. The Black Lives Matter movement and the police had similar favorability ratings, with 44 percent of registered voters viewing the movement as “very favorable,” almost identical to the 43 percent rating for the police.

The numbers add to the mounting evidence that recent protests have significantly shifted public opinion on race, creating potential political allies for a movement that was, within the past decade, dismissed as fringe and divisive. It also highlights how President Trump is increasingly out of touch with a country he is seeking to lead for a second term: While he has shown little sympathy for the protesters and their fight for racial justice, and has continued to use racist language that many have denounced, voters feel favorably toward the protests and their cause.

A survey of battleground states critical to November’s election largely mirrored the national results. Fifty-four percent of voters in those states said the way the criminal justice system treats black Americans was a bigger problem than the incidents of rioting seen during some demonstrations. Just 37 percent said rioting was a bigger problem, though Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to discredit the protests by focusing on some isolated incidents of violence."/['Astead W.

In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who has resisted rolling back the economic reopening, banned drinking in bars after saying that patrons were not abiding by social distancing rules. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, also a Republican, went further, ordering all bars closed in the state. And Judge Lina Hidalgo of Harris County, the largest county in Texas, reimposed stay-at-home orders on Friday, calling the rise in cases there “a catastrophic and unsustainable situation.”

Taken together, it was grim news about a pandemic that is still a threat to the public’s health, the nation’s economy and the president’s political future.

At a time when his poll numbers now call into question whether he can win a second term in November, Mr. Trump faces the prospect that his efforts to boost the economy by shrugging off the virus have backfired. Rather than head into the summer with a country on the mend, the president will be forced to explain how his response to the coronavirus contributed to a resurgence of it that may force some Americans back into a painful shutdown.

And yet Mr. Trump made no appearance at the task force briefing to demonstrate concern. Instead, an hour after it was over, the president addressed a panel of industry officials, political allies and White House economic advisers for a self-congratulatory session about how successful the economic recovery has been.

In taking his victory lap, Mr. Trump made no mention of the increase in cases around the country, underscoring a message that he posted on Twitter late Thursday night: “Our Economy is roaring back and will NOT be shut down. ‘Embers’ or flare ups will be put out, as necessary!”"/['Michael D.

Hopeful./"Despite double digit unemployment, majorities across demographic groups say the federal government’s priority should be to contain the spread of the virus, even if it hurts the economy. Younger voters and black voters take the most stringent view of the social distancing rules, with more than four in 10 saying the guidance is being lifted too quickly. Only backers of Mr. Trump overwhelmingly believe government should prioritize the economy.

More than three-quarters of registered voters say they always or mostly wear a mask in public when they expect to be within six feet of another person, including 60 percent who support Mr. Trump and 79 percent of those under 30.

Men are more likely to go barefaced. Only 46 percent of men say they always wear a mask, compared with 61 percent of women. The findings confirm academic research suggesting that men are more likely to opt out of wearing masks, believing them to be “not cool” or “a sign of weakness,” even though men are at a higher risk of dying from Covid-19 than women.

In the most heavily impacted states, voters feel even more strongly about taking measures to stop the spread of the virus. A higher percentage of voters in Arizona and Florida, where infections are spiking, say restrictions don’t go far enough and that businesses are reopening too quickly.

Scott Bertoglio, 33, of suburban Phoenix, said he is considering not sending his three young children back to school in the fall because he was worried that the state government has failed to adequately implement rules protecting their health, like mandating mask wearing.

“We’ve essentially been holed up at home,” he said, taking a break from watching a PowerPoint presentation in his home office. “But Arizona is not taking it seriously and the schools are saying we’re going to open.”

Still, the poll shows that voters overwhelmingly believe that any economic pain stemming from the virus will be temporary. Even among those living in a household with coronavirus-related job losses, 81 percent say they expect to find work within the next few months or have already regained it."/['Lisa Lerer', 'Elaina Plott', 'Lazaro Gamio']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/26/us/politics/26mood-poll1/26mood-poll1-facebookJumbo.jpg"

While L.G.B.T.Q. people have secured many legal rights and protections, black transgender women are still killed so often that the American Medical Association has declared it an epidemic. Last year, 91 percent of the transgender or gender-nonconforming people who were fatally shot were black women, according to the Human Rights Campaign. This year, at least 16 trans people have been killed — almost certainly an underestimate, because many cases go unreported and many victims are misgendered.

“So much money and resources and energy has been put into legislative fights or judicial fights, which is important — those wins are important,” the activist Raquel Willis said. “But as a black trans woman, I often have to grapple with the question of, what do any of these protections mean if I am dead, if I am still at risk of literally being killed?”

Violence against transgender people increased after President Trump was inaugurated, advocacy groups found in 2017, and Mr. Trump has singled out trans people in his policies since the beginning of his presidency.

His administration reversed Obama-era protections for transgender students, reimposed a ban on trans people serving in the military and, just this month, erased rules protecting them from discrimination in health care. It also sought to define gender as an immutable trait assigned at birth — an effort that would, essentially, define trans people out of legal existence."/['Isabella Grullón Paz', 'Maggie Astor']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/28/us/politics/28trans-politics-p1/00trans-politics00-facebookJumbo.jpg"

The university’s board of trustees found that Wilson’s “racist thinking and policies make him an inappropriate namesake for a school or college whose scholars, students and alumni must stand firmly against racism in all its forms,” Princeton’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, said in a statement.

“Wilson’s racism was significant and consequential even by the standards of his own time,” Mr. Eisgruber said. Wilson was the university’s president from 1902 to 1910 before becoming the U.S. president in 1913.

Wilson had overseen the resegregation of federal government offices, including the Treasury Department. In a meeting in the Oval Office with the civil rights leader Monroe Trotter, Wilson said, “Segregation is not humiliating, but a benefit, and ought to be so regarded by you gentlemen,” according to a transcript of the meeting."/['Bryan Pietsch']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/multimedia/27xp-unrest-princeton-wilson-pix1/27xp-unrest-princeton-wilson-pix1-facebookJumbo.jpg"

“The problem has expanded,” said Representative Kim Schrier, Democrat of Washington and a pediatrician.

Because of border restrictions amid the pandemic, Ms. Schrier said, some in her state can no longer drive to Canada to purchase insulin at a fraction of what it costs in the United States. “There’s this fear that we’re going to run out of medications, so people are trying to get more in hand,” she said.

Mr. Mitchell said that his group had observed significant price increases on drugs needed for coronavirus patients, including anticoagulants for blood clots.

“There’s more of a sense of urgency,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey and the main sponsor of the House bill, called H.R. 3, which was given a low number to reflect its top ranking among Democratic priorities. “So many people have lost their jobs. So many people have lost income. They’re more conscious than ever of the price of health care.”

Mr. Grassley’s bill would cap the growth of drug prices in Medicare at inflation level, and impose a $3,100 limit on out-of-pocket costs for tens of millions of seniors and Americans with disabilities enrolled in its drug coverage program. The plan would provide nearly $100 billion in savings, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The House bill goes further in seeking to control the growth of drug costs, calling for the secretary of health and human services to negotiate prices with manufacturers, a provision that is projected to save more than $500 billion over a decade, according to the C.B.O.

For some of his 130 million followers, it was a signal.

In the video, someone had posted a comment asking Mr. Bieber to touch his hat if he had been a victim of a child-trafficking ring known as PizzaGate. Thousands of comments were flooding in, and there was no evidence that Mr. Bieber had seen that message. But the pop star’s innocuous gesture set off a flurry of online activity, which highlighted the resurgence of one of social media’s early conspiracy theories.

Viewers quickly uploaded hundreds of videos online analyzing Mr. Bieber’s action. The videos were translated into Spanish, Portuguese and other languages, amassing millions of views. Fans then left thousands of comments on Mr. Bieber’s social media posts asking him if he was safe. Within days, searches for “Justin and PizzaGate” soared on Google, and the hashtag #savebieber started trending.

Four years ago, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the baseless notion that Hillary Clinton and Democratic elites were running a child sex-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizzeria spread across the internet, illustrating how a crackpot idea with no truth to it could blossom on social media — and how dangerous it could be.

President Barack Obama vowed to close it, and failed. President Trump vowed to load it up with more “bad dudes,” and has not. Now Joseph R.

In response to a question, his campaign said in a statement that Mr. Biden “continues to support closing the detention center.” Echoing Mr. Obama, the statement said the prison “undermines American national security by fueling terrorist recruitment and is at odds with our values as a country.”

But Mr. Biden rarely, if ever, brings up the topic, evidence of how politically toxic it remains after intense Republican efforts to cast Mr. Obama’s initiative as endangering Americans by transferring terrorists to U.S. soil or sending them without adequate safeguards to other countries.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times’s Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church, George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process and meatloaf. Politically, I’m grief-stricken over the way President Trump has governed and I’m left of center, but I don’t think that the center is a bad place or “compromise” a dirty word. I’m Italian-American, I’m gay and I write a weekly Times newsletter in which you’ll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of our Manhattan apartment.

The number of new U.S. cases this last week surged dangerously high, to levels not ever seen in the course of the pandemic, especially in states that had rushed to reopen their economies. The result has been a realization for many Americans that however much they have yearned for a return to normalcy, their leaders have failed to control the coronavirus pandemic. And there is little clarity on what comes next.

“There has to be a clear coherent sustained communication, and that has absolutely not happened,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. “We’ve had just the opposite and now it’s hard to unring a whole series of bells.”

There was “real hubris” on the part of public health officials at the very start, Dr. Schaffner said, that the United States could lock down and contain the virus as China had. That futile hope helped create an unrealistic expectation that the shutdown, while intense, would not be for long, and that when it was lifted life would return to normal."/['Sabrina Tavernise', 'Frances Robles', 'Louis Keene']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/us/27virus-sacrifie-1/27virus-sacrifie-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"

On Friday, the country reported more than 45,000 new infections, its third consecutive day of record new cases, and a number of states have also been seeing record new levels. On Saturday, Florida, Nevada and South Carolina reported their highest one-day case totals. Before this week, the country’s largest daily total had been 36,738 on April 24.

Many business owners and workers who lost their jobs say they believe their leaders failed to prepare for the economic devastation that followed shutdowns that states had adopted, to differing degrees, since March. And they say that recent reopenings undercut their sacrifices.

In recent weeks, some conservatives said they had an additional concern: After weeks of being told that going to church, attending funerals and participating in protests was a willful, careless spurning of science, political leaders and some public health officials condoned — and even joined — the crowds protesting the killing of George Floyd.

“It’s just a real social whiplash,” said Philip Campbell, vice president of a pest control company in Central Michigan, who took part in the first protests against the lockdown in Lansing in April from the cab of his truck. “Two weeks ago you can’t go out because you are going to kill grandma. Now it’s ‘you have an obligation to go out.’ It leaves me feeling that the science and the public health authorities have been politicized.”

A number of states are reconsidering their reopening plans. Florida and Texas reimposed limits on bars, banning drinking inside or closing the premises entirely, as they scrambled to control what appeared to be a brewing public health catastrophe. All this is leaving people with a strange sense of déjà vu and a bitterness at public officials for what felt like a fumbling of people’s sacrifices.

The C.D.C. study found, for instance, that in South Florida, just under 2 percent of the population had been exposed to the virus as of April 10, but the proportion is likely to be higher now given the surge of infections in the state. The prevalence was highest in New York City at nearly 7 percent as of April 1.

“This study underscores that there are probably a lot of people infected without knowing it, likely because they have mild or asymptomatic infection,” said Dr. Fiona Havers, who led the C.D.C. study. “But those people could still spread it to others.”"/['Apoorva Mandavilli']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/us/27virus-briefing-cdc1/27virus-briefing-cdc1-facebookJumbo.jpg"

Mr. Burden, of the Election Research Center, said it was worth worrying about: “Printers have limited machines and employees, so they can’t scale up” to meet massive demand, he said. “There’s an ongoing concern that some jurisdictions are going to be left out.”

The Russians are coming. So are Americans.

Among election experts, the prospect that voters will be gulled by misinformation to dismiss November’s results as invalid or rigged is a top concern. Increasingly, Americans, not foreigners, are seen as the greatest threat.

President Trump and some Republicans have ratcheted up baseless charges that voting by mail is riddled with fraud, and many on the left assume voter suppression is baked into every element of voting.

Experts worry that delays in counting mail ballots will encourage some people to sow charges of fraud and suppression that are amplified by foreign adversaries. Experts are especially concerned that Americans accustomed to getting election results before bedtime will embrace conspiracy theories and disinformation if the November vote takes days to sort out, as seems likely.

“There is going to be stuff that goes wrong, that isn’t perfect, and our adversaries are looking to leverage that,” said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. “Everyone expects there will be a fight against disinformation that is seeking to diminish confidence in the election results — no matter who wins.”

Steve Connolly can speak to that. Mr. Connolly, who bills himself as the longest-running Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas, arrived at his polling place at 6:45 p.m. on June 9 and cast his vote at 3:09 a.m. on June 10, the last voter in Nevada’s Clark County, He was not happy, but he thinks he may have a solution.

“It made me want to run for mayor so I can fix the system,” he said. “I’ve been Elvis for 25 years. Maybe it’s time for another career.”"/['Michael Wines']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/us/27virus-voting-1/27virus-voting-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"

Change is coming to the daily vertical commute, as workers begin to return to tall office buildings in New York and other cities. The elevator ride, a previously unremarkable 90 or so seconds, has become a daunting puzzler in the calculus of how to bring people back to work safely after the coronavirus pandemic kept them home for months.

Employers and building managers are drafting strict rules for going up: severe limits on the number of riders (four seems to be the new magic number), designated standing spots to maximize social distance, mandatory masks, required forward-facing positions — and no talking.

Some companies are hiring “elevator consultants” to figure how best to get thousands of people to their desks, balancing risk of elevator density against a potential logjam as riders wait — at least six feet apart — for their turn.

Reflecting the widespread interest and concern, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to weigh in as early as next week with guidance for elevators and escalators. For escalators, it will advise one rider every other step and hand sanitizer at the top. For elevators, it will recommend limiting the number of riders but won’t specify a number; arrows showing different paths to get on and get off; masks; and signs urging people to “not talk unless you have to,” said Nancy Clark Burton, a senior industrial hygienist at the C.D.C. who is part of the group developing the new guidance."/['Matt Richtel']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/23/science/00VIRUS-ELEVATORS1/00VIRUS-ELEVATORS1-facebookJumbo.jpg"

Note: Countries are grouped according to how the seven-day average of new cases has changed from two weeks ago to today. Countries with fewer than 100 cases are not shown.

While Wednesday’s total, the record high, was inflated by a backlog of more than 30,000 mishandled and unreported cases that Chile added to its tally, the rising daily numbers reflect the pandemic’s stubborn grip on the world.

Brazil reported more than 32,000 new cases on Wednesday, the most in the world, and the United States was second, with more than 25,000. The leaders of both nations have been criticized for their handling of the outbreak.

On Thursday, California and Florida reported their highest daily totals of new cases yet. And Texas became the sixth state in the nation to surpass 100,000 cases, according to a New York Times database. Cases there have doubled over the past month.

The virus is also taking off in other parts of the world.

If the outbreak was defined early on by a series of shifting epicenters — including Wuhan, China; Iran; northern Italy; Spain; and New York — it is now defined by its wide and expanding scope. And more risks lie ahead as nations begin to reopen their economies.

In India, which initially placed all 1.3 billion of its citizens under a lockdown — then moved to reopen even with its strained public health system near the breaking point — officials reported a record number of new cases Wednesday. And the virus is now spreading rapidly in nearby Pakistan and Bangladesh as well.

It took Africa nearly 100 days to reach 100,000 cases, the World Health Organization noted, but only 19 days to double that tally. South Africa now averages a thousand more new cases each day than it did two weeks ago.

And some countries where caseloads had appeared to taper — including Israel, Sweden and Costa Rica — are now watching them rise again.

Yet the latest efforts for change have gained momentum in large part because of economic considerations, with business and industry leaders saying that the flag discourages the investment needed to boost one of the poorest states.

The financial threat had been underscored by recent announcements by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Southeastern Conference that Mississippi would be precluded from hosting championship events until the flag is changed.

“Because of the N.C.A.A. and the SEC, we can point to a quantifiable damage, if you will, that is occurring — a consequence, a punishment,” Philip Gunn, a Republican who is the State House speaker, said in an interview on Friday afternoon.

Still, the growing calls to change the flag belie the extent of the division that still exists over the banner and how to interpret the legacy it symbolizes. Various polls show that, even as the number of people supporting a change has increased, nearly half of the state is resistant to the idea.

Many remain attached to the flag because they see it as an enduring recognition of the blood shed by their ancestors who fought for Mississippi and their pride in the state’s history.

“We firmly believe that this political correctness, this movement we are sensing out there right now to delegitimize our American institutions and our American history is a movement that’s incredibly dangerous and cannot be appeased,” said Chris McDaniel, a Republican state senator."/['Rick Rojas']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/us/27unrest-mississippi-unrest-SWAP/27unrest-mississippi-unrest-SWAP-facebookJumbo.jpg"

Hopeful./"Despite double digit unemployment, majorities across demographic groups say the federal government’s priority should be to contain the spread of the virus, even if it hurts the economy. Younger voters and black voters take the most stringent view of the social distancing rules, with more than four in 10 saying the guidance is being lifted too quickly. Only backers of Mr. Trump overwhelmingly believe government should prioritize the economy.

More than three-quarters of registered voters say they always or mostly wear a mask in public when they expect to be within six feet of another person, including 60 percent who support Mr. Trump and 79 percent of those under 30.

Men are more likely to go barefaced. Only 46 percent of men say they always wear a mask, compared with 61 percent of women. The findings confirm academic research suggesting that men are more likely to opt out of wearing masks, believing them to be “not cool” or “a sign of weakness,” even though men are at a higher risk of dying from Covid-19 than women.

In the most heavily impacted states, voters feel even more strongly about taking measures to stop the spread of the virus. A higher percentage of voters in Arizona and Florida, where infections are spiking, say restrictions don’t go far enough and that businesses are reopening too quickly.

Scott Bertoglio, 33, of suburban Phoenix, said he is considering not sending his three young children back to school in the fall because he was worried that the state government has failed to adequately implement rules protecting their health, like mandating mask wearing.

“We’ve essentially been holed up at home,” he said, taking a break from watching a PowerPoint presentation in his home office. “But Arizona is not taking it seriously and the schools are saying we’re going to open.”

Still, the poll shows that voters overwhelmingly believe that any economic pain stemming from the virus will be temporary.

But Mr. Hickenlooper, who was coaxed into the Senate contest after ending his brief presidential run, has faltered in recent weeks ahead of the primary race on Tuesday. He now finds himself in a tougher-than-expected contest with Andrew Romanoff, a former state House speaker and another longtime Colorado political presence, in a fight with significant implications for the general election and control of the Senate.

At a time when Democrats sense fresh momentum for flipping the Senate amid national crises that have tarnished President Trump and threaten to drag down Republican candidates, Mr. Hickenlooper’s shaky primary performance has been a rare dark spot in an otherwise brightening landscape. Democrats would have a difficult time capturing the majority without a Centennial State victory.

“He has had a bad June,” Kyle Saunders, a political-science professor at Colorado State University, said about Mr. Hickenlooper’s multiple travails and missteps.

The children in the neighborhood planned to go on a trip to McDonald’s just to have some fun, something different to do.” “Rosedale we thought was a safe place. We all went down. We were riding our bikes.” “And then we saw down the block that there was this beautiful American flag flowing in the wind.” “We saw a group outside on the block. So we was like, ‘Oh, this is a block party.’” “The last thing that I remember was someone saying, ‘Oh, a parade.’ And so we went down to go see the parade, and I laugh about it to this day because it was a parade to get the black people out of Rosedale.” Crowd: “White power — white resistance.” It’s the summer of 1975. White residents in Rosedale, Queens, are protesting black families moving into the neighborhood. [shouting] Crowd: “Equal rights for whites.” These are scenes from a documentary produced by journalist Bill Moyers. “Does he have a right to live here?” “No.” “Why not?” “Because he’s black.” “This was not the South. This was not Greenville, Miss., or Spartanburg, S.C., or Atlanta, Ga. This was right in the heart of the greatest metropolitan area in the country.” The documentary was found nearly 45 years later by a graduate student who posted a short clip on the internet. It went viral on Twitter and Facebook. And the question people kept asking, where are the kids now? “Hey, Rob, this is Whitney Hurst calling from The New York Times. My name is Whitney Hurst. I’m a journalist —” To answer that question, we called more than 90 people who had lived in Rosedale at that time. “I’m just trying to find anyone that might have known someone.” We couldn’t find any white residents who said they’d been there. “Came out because it got a little bit crazy.” But we spoke with several of the black children. We wanted to hear what happened to them that day to understand why their experience is resonating decades later. “We went down to see what was going on. Probably in the middle of the block, that’s when we figured out it was something else, and it was something that we definitely were not invited to.” “We noticed that they were running towards us. I was like, ‘Wow.’ You know, like, ‘Why are they rushing towards us,’ not thinking anything negative. And then we heard nigger.” [crowd shouting racial slurs] “Yeah, nigger!” “And they surrounded my best friend at the time, Lorena — one of the young men hit her, and they started calling us names. They started throwing rocks.” “Hearing the word, hearing it directed at me — ‘Why are you calling me that? That’s not me.’ You know, I’ve always been told that’s not me. I didn’t understand. I was like, ‘Who do you think you are to say we can’t come here?’ Like, how dare you?” “What happened to you?” “This little boy, he threw the rock. He tried to hit my sister, but he almost hit me. It was about that much away from me. And I sure wish he had hit me with that rock. I would pick up the rock right next to me and hit him right dead in his face.” “I was just kind of amazed to see that people can act like that, to tell you the truth. But that was like really the first when I was like, ‘Wow, people do not like black people.’” “They always do that. They always spit on us like we some dogs. They always —” “Spit back on them.” “Ain’t nothing going to change.” “I immediately was reminded of those programs my parents would have me watch with the dogs and the hoses, and people trying to vote and being killed and lynched. It just, it went right back to my history in this country. It just linked me immediately with that whole experience because I felt it.” “Do you forgive them?” “No. No. No. Can’t take back no hurt.” “And I didn’t know what to do with those feelings. I did not know what to do with those feelings.” For Moyers, the video going viral shows how powerful images can be. “He just tried to hit my sister, but —” “Because we were in their neighborhood.” “I mean, I do believe that television has been a great teacher. This country didn’t really respond to what was going on in the South, although it was well known, until the sheriff in Birmingham turned the water hoses and the dogs on those young people who were demonstrating there. We knew about it. We heard about it. We were aware of it, but we didn’t see it. We couldn’t escape it once we saw it.” “As we filmed in Rosedale, a group of blacks from South Jamaica was coming through the neighborhood in a demonstration of support.” “Every time a group of blacks get together, they want to help Rosedale with their problems. We don’t need any outsiders helping us with our problems, and we’ll stay white, period.” Crowd: “Right on. Right on.” “All right, so guys, this next scene is very disturbing, all right? It’s the one I was telling you about yesterday. I started a sociology elective in 2004-2005 school year, and my supervisor at the time said, ‘Come up with something that’s close to home that maybe you can relate to today.’ I grew up in Rosedale.” “… and think that I have a right —” “And I said, ‘I want to do a unit on race in America.’ And that Rosedale video, we’ve been showing it for 15 years now, giving it to the kids and say, ‘What do you think?’” “I’ve never seen racism on camera.

Instead of telling hard truths in this polarized environment, America’s newsrooms too often deprive their readers of plainly stated facts that could expose reporters to accusations of partiality or imbalance.

For years, I’ve been among a chorus of mainstream journalists who have called for our industry to abandon the appearance of objectivity as the aspirational journalistic standard, and for reporters instead to focus on being fair and telling the truth, as best as one can, based on the given context and available facts.

It’s not a novel argument. Scores of journalists across generations, from gonzo reporters like Hunter S. Thompson to more traditional voices like Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, have advocated this very approach. Mr. Kovach and Mr. Rosenstiel lay it out in detail in their classic text “The Elements of Journalism.”

Those of us advancing this argument know that a fairness-and-truth focus will have different, healthy interpretations. We also know that neutral “objective journalism” is constructed atop a pyramid of subjective decision-making: which stories to cover, how intensely to cover those stories, which sources to seek out and include, which pieces of information are highlighted and which are downplayed. No journalistic process is objective. And no individual journalist is objective, because no human being is.

And so, instead of promising our readers that we will never, on any platform, betray a single personal bias — submitting ourselves to a life sentence of public thoughtlessness — a better pledge would be an assurance that we will devote ourselves to accuracy, that we will diligently seek out the perspectives of those with whom we personally may be inclined to disagree and that we will be just as sure to ask hard questions of those with whom we’re inclined to agree.

Whatever his wobbles, Joe Biden has, from the start of his presidential campaign, got one thing exactly right: The 2020 election is a battle for the soul of America. That’s not just a pretty slogan. It’s the stomach-knotting truth — and it’s the frame he should use for choosing his running mate.

It’s why he should pick Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois.

She’s a paragon of the values that Donald Trump, for all his practice as a performer, can’t even pantomime. She’s best described by words that are musty relics in his venal and vainglorious circle: “sacrifice,” “honor,” “humility.” More than any of the many extraordinary women on Biden’s list of potential vice-presidential nominees, she’s the anti-Trump, the antidote to the ugliness he revels in and the cynicism he stokes.

Americans can feel good — no, wonderful — about voting for a ticket with Duckworth on it. And we’re beyond hungry for that. We’re starving.

My grandmother, father, and mother all worked as nurses. I chose nursing because I knew you could always get a job. I never went to work with my parents, but they talked about it at the dinner table every night. I knew they loved their jobs. So I decided to do the same thing they did.

My benefits are horrible compared to my parents’ and they let me know it. When I first got my job I remember going to my parents’ house to help me sign up for benefits. And they just couldn’t believe how bad my health insurance was. I thought because I was in health care that I'd have really good insurance, but I was wrong. I think the hospital does it to save money.

My parents used to work 40 hours a week, doing eight-hour shifts five days a week. But most nursing jobs now, you work three 12-hour shifts, which is just 36 hours a week. Even the pay difference from 36 to 40 hours is huge. And it’s harder to get overtime when you’re not working 40 hours. I think I get paid a pretty similar amount hourly to what my parents did, but they always worked 40 hours a week and I work 36.

It was super common to have a union when my parents were working; their benefits and wages were protected. I don’t think my parents would have taken a job that wasn’t union.

There's a lot of things that happen at my work that I feel wouldn't happen if we had a union. We have something called low-census days. If we have fewer than 16 patients on the unit, they'll say that one of the nurses has to stay home. You have to use paid time off (PTO) to get paid, or you won't get paid. It’s stressful because every year when you get new PTO you have to make sure you're saving some of it for low-census days. You never know when our unit might be low. That would never happen at my parents’ jobs. My parents have said they would not tolerate being treated like that, but almost all nursing jobs now have low-census days.

We have a 403(b) retirement savings plan, but because of Covid-19, the hospital is not contributing to that at all right now. When the pandemic started, our hospital was losing money because we had to have every patient in their own room. They sent out an email saying that they're not contributing to our retirement until further notice. That's pretty stressful.

In spite of all that, I do really like being a nurse. It’s really active. All day I’m out on the unit playing games with patients or talking to them. I walk up and down the hallway with the medicine cart. It’s just interesting to talk to different people all the time. And the staff that I work with, we’re always laughing. I feel like I have a strong community with the other nurses."/['Lora Kelley']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/opinion/generational-inequality-1593120145501/generational-inequality-1593120145501-facebookJumbo.jpg"

The irony is not lost on me: Many of those who are eagerly extending Zoom invitations are complicit in a system that desperately needs changing.

I do see progress. I see business leaders like Marc Benioff, Ursula Burns, Ray Dalio, Paul Polman and others acknowledge that we conduct our daily work in a system built on unfair incentives. This system puts the interests of capital over labor, while it compounds privilege at the expense of opportunity.

The boardroom elite are beginning to recognize that these unfairly structured incentives have grossly distorted our economy. I see an evolving understanding that our twisted economy is an existential threat that has pushed our republic to a breaking point.

This awareness is necessary. But it is not sufficient.

The old playbook — giving back through philanthropy as a way of ameliorating the effects of inequality — cannot heal what ails our nation. It cannot address the root causes of this inequality — what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called “the circumstances of economic injustice which make philanthropy necessary.”

Instead, those of us with power and privilege must grapple with a more profound question: What are we willing to give up?

If we, the beneficiaries of a system that perpetuates inequality, are trying to reform this system that favors us, we will have to give up something. Here are a few of the special privileges and benefits we should be willing to surrender: the intricate web of tax policies that bolster our wealth; the entrenched system in American colleges of legacy admissions, which gives a leg up to our children; and above all, the expectation that, because of our money, we are entitled to a place at the front of the line."/['Darren Walker', 'Robert B.

Protect Their Rights. - The New York Times/"These workers are essential not only in the present. They are essential in the future. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the job projected to have the largest percentage increase in employment from 2018 to 2028 is the home health aide followed by the personal care aide, a reflection of the growing older population in America.

Despite the increasing need for these workers, home health aides and personal care aides typically earn less than $12 per hour. And they are overwhelmingly women of color, and disproportionately black women: 87 percent of paid adult care workers are women, compared with 46 percent of nondomestic workers, and about 25 percent of home care aides are black, compared with 12 percent of nondomestic workers.

The workers we need the most aren’t wearing boots and hard hats; they are wearing sneakers or scrubs.

We are at a critical juncture. The future of work will be decided by how we respond to this moment.

This is our moment to choose a future where we invest in the work that we now know is essential. Where care jobs become living-wage jobs with benefits, protected by a strong federal safety net. Where essential workers can support their own families through their work, even as they support ours.

Or we can continue down the path we are on. As companies consider how they will use the economic recession as a moment to reset, they will be making choices that determine the future of millions of jobs. More jobs could be outsourced, subcontracted and offshored, deconstructed into tasks or automated. Many jobs that were lost may never return. Increasing numbers of the jobs that do return could become gigs that are farmed out to disaggregated workforces managed by algorithms. Too many of us could end up working along a Walmart or Amazon supply chain, while not earning enough to shop there. And more jobs might become inputs into an equation, without recognition, value or access to a safety net. Most economic choices we’ve made in recent decades make that possibility likely."/['Ai-Jen Poo', 'Palak Shah', 'Robert B.

Case in point: The more we learn about J. Edgar Hoover, the more outrageous it is that the F.B.I. building in Washington is still named for him.

These are the easy cases. Equally easy are the opposite cases.

Hans Christian Heg, an ardent abolitionist whose statue in Madison, Wis., was pulled down this week, fell at the Battle of Chickamauga trying to make a more perfect union. Robert Gould Shaw, who commanded one of the first black Union regiments and whose monument in Boston was defaced last month, was killed at Fort Wagner trying to make a more perfect union. Ulysses Grant, who did more than any other general to defeat the Confederacy and more than any other president to defeat the Klan, and whose statue in San Francisco was pulled down last week, devoted his life to trying to make a more perfect union.

What about, say, Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson or George Washington?

The central case against Washington and Jefferson is that they were slaveholders, albeit ones who knew slavery was wrong. If their fault lay in being creatures of their time, their greatness was in their ability to look past it. An unbroken moral thread connects the Declaration of Independence to the Gettysburg Address to Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” speech. An unbroken political thread connects the first president to the 16th to the 44th. It’s impossible to imagine any union, much less the possibility of a more perfect one, without them.

Jackson and Roosevelt? Both were avowed racists, and the Indian Removal Act of 1830, enacted during Jackson’s presidency, stands with the Chinese Exclusion Act as one of the most shameful pieces of American legislation.

But there’s historical irony in the fact that some of today’s progressives are eager to bring down statues to the two most progressive presidents of their times. Roosevelt busted trusts, championed conservation, and caused a scandal by inviting Booker T. Washington to dine with his family in the White House.

She acknowledged that there must be hungry children but added: “If people knew kids were hungry, they would help. The community would step up.”

On the other end of the United States, Latinos in New York City display a similar resilience. Dr. Carmen Isasi, an epidemiologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who has studied LatinX populations, said that lately she has seen signs on Spanish-speaking churches offering food for the needy.

Scholars have been debating the Hispanic Paradox at least since 1974, when researchers found that the neonatal mortality rate in Texas was lower for people with Spanish surnames than with English surnames.

Researchers have found another paradox within the paradox: First-generation Latino immigrants tend to live longest, and their children — while better educated and earning more money — die earlier. Moreover, Latinos embedded in ethnic enclaves seem to do better than those who live in heterogeneous neighborhoods.

Part of the explanation may be that what many white Americans think of as “traditional American values” — an emphasis on faith, family and community ties — are disproportionately found among Latino immigrants, but then fade as their children assimilate.

“If we find that someone needs help, we help them,” Raúl González Hernández, who works in a plant nursery and has just recovered from Covid-19, told me. He said that others had helped him when he arrived from Michoacán State in Mexico, so he wants to pay it forward — particularly if the person needing help is also from Michoacán.

I’ve been long interested in the Hispanic Paradox because I grew up in a mostly white farm town in Oregon that has been devastated by lost jobs.

It’s a feeling of hiatus, intermission, like the days between Christmas and the new year, or some extra season invented by a Renaissance pope to fix a lagging calendar.

Yet at the same time there’s a feeling of acceleration, of changes that might have otherwise dragged out across a decade piling one atop the other. The George Floyd protests and their electoral consequences, the transformation of liberal institutions by internal agitation, the changes happening to cities and corporations and colleges and churches — in each case, trends that were working slowly have seemingly speeded up.

This means that when the coronavirus era finally ends, there will be a Rip Van Winkle feeling — a sense of having been asleep and waking to normality, except that we will have time-traveled and the normality will resemble the year 2030 as it might have been without the virus, rather than just a simple turn to 2021 or 2022."/['Ross Douthat']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/28/opinion/28douthat1/28douthat1-facebookJumbo.jpg"

I bought it knowing I might never make it here, that I’d have to risk my life to try. In my rowhouse in the clatter of Washington, D.C., my only view was the back of another house, about as far as I’d ever been able to see during years spent largely housebound with an illness that was finally beginning to let me go.

One day five years ago, I saw a photograph of this house and its gobsmacking view of a mountain, of shining rivers, of forests and hills that folded over one another into infinity. I hung my heart on that view, bought the house and one morning six months later, climbed into an RV and set off for Oregon in hopes of inventing my life out of nothing.

On an autumn day, I finally arrived. One of the first things to arrest me was the Norway maple in the backyard. It was an exuberant explosion of a tree, its foliage so full that the branches kissed the ground. Each summer, the tree bounded outward in all directions, growing perhaps two feet; each fall, its torrent of huge orange leaves whirled through the air like laughter. The tree was so in love with life that it swallowed the sky.

This year, in which everything has felt sundered, the tree became my refuge. In the mornings, I began carrying a pillow to it and ducking under the branches, finding myself in a magical green cave.

As the historian Eric S. Yellin of the University of Richmond documents in his powerful book “Racism in the Nation’s Service,” my grandfather’s demotion was part of a systematic purge of the federal government; with Wilson’s approval, in a few short years virtually all blacks had been removed from management responsibilities, moved to menial jobs or simply dismissed.

My grandfather died before I was born, but I have learned much about his struggle — and that of other black civil servants in the federal government — from his personnel file. What is most striking is his sense of humiliation; after all, he had spent his career in a time and place where, whatever was happening in the South, African-Americans were able to get ahead. And then, suddenly, with Wilson’s election, that all changed.

Consider a letter he wrote on May 16, 1913, barely a month after his demotion. “The reputation which I have been able to acquire and maintain at considerable sacrifice,” he wrote, “is to me (foolish as it may appear to those in higher stations of life) a source of personal pride, a possession of which I am very jealous and which is possessed at a value in my estimation ranking above the loss of salary — though the last, to a man having a family of small children to rear, is serious enough.”

And the reply he received? His supervisor said, simply, that my grandfather was unable to “properly perform the duties required (he is too slow).” Yet there had never been any indication of this in his personnel file.

Wilson was not just a racist. He believed in white supremacy as government policy, so much so that he reversed decades of racial progress. But we would be wrong to see this as a mere policy change; in doing so, he ruined the lives of countless talented African-Americans and their families.

We were in conversation across a picnic table on a drab Soviet-era campus in Zagreb, an early-autumn breeze swishing through the yellowing leaves of some nearby trees. “It’s a baby, it’s nothing — 100 years in the history of science. How can you just stop there? It doesn’t make sense any way you look at it.” We sat in the shadow of a rust-stained beige building where Bassi was about to speak at a workshop for physicists who specialize in the century-old subject.

Despite the theory’s advancing years, even college-educated adults tend to have only a hazy sense of what quantum mechanics says. And for good reason. Although physicists use it to predict the behavior of the fundamental particles, like electrons, that make up atoms and the photons that make up light, and in spite of its having been the basis of many of the 20th century’s signature technologies (including nuclear power, lasers and computers), the theory has confounded even the cognoscenti from its beginnings in the 1920s. That’s because, while it’s spectacular at making predictions, it doesn’t describe what’s actually happening underneath nature’s hood to make those results come about. It would be one thing to concede that science may never be able to explain, say, the subjective experiences of the human mind. But the standard take on quantum mechanics suggests something far more surprising: that a complete understanding of even the objective, physical world is beyond science’s reach, since it’s impossible to translate into words how the theory’s math relates to the world we live in.

Bassi, a 47-year-old theoretical physicist at the University of Trieste, in northeastern Italy, is prominent among a tiny minority of rebels in the discipline who reject this conclusion. “I strongly believe that physics is words, in a sense,” he said across the picnic table. And whereas all the other talks at the workshop focused on the empirical implications of quantum mechanics, Bassi’s would make a case for what a vast majority of his colleagues consider a highly implausible idea: that the theory upon which nearly all of modern physics rests must have something wrong with it — precisely because it can’t be put into words.

Of course, much about quantum mechanics can be said with words. Like the fact that a particle’s future whereabouts can’t be specified by the theory, only predicted with probabilities. And that those probabilities derive from each particle’s “wave function,” a set of numbers that varies over time, as per an equation devised by Erwin Schrödinger in 1925. But because the wave function’s numbers have no obvious meaning, the theory only predicts what scientists may see at the instant of observation — when all the wave function’s latent possibilities appear to collapse to one definitive outcome — and provides no narrative at all for what particles actually do before or after that, or even how much the word “particle” is apropos to the unobserved world. The theory, in fact, suggests that particles, while they’re not being observed, behave more like waves — a fact called “wave-particle duality” that’s related to how all those latent possibilities seem to indicate that an unobserved particle can exist in several places at once. The act of observation itself is then posited to somehow convert this nonsensical situation into the world we see, of objects having definite locations and other properties.

For players and fans around the world such an extraordinary feat would be far beyond their wildest imagination.

But for Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold, his fairytale dream has become a reality -- all at the age of just 21.

""It's hard to even comprehend what's actually happened -- I'm over the moon,"" a beaming Alexander-Arnold told CNN Sport after the club secured its first league title in 30 years on Thursday.

The right-back celebrated the achievement with his teammates and coaching staff at a golf resort in the city as they watched Chelsea beat Manchester City 2-1 -- thereby handing them the trophy with a record seven games to spare.

He admits, though, it wasn't quite the way he'd pictured such a historic moment playing out in his imagination.

""I always dreamt it as a last minute winner. It was a tight, tight title race up until the last minute and we'd scored an equalizer to win the league,"" he smiles.

He likely pictured that moment with fans in the stadium, too, but the coronavirus pandemic means games are being played behind closed doors.

Fans celebrated Liverpool winning the title outside Anfield stadium.

One icon inspires another

The England international joined the club as a six-year-old and immediately caught the eye of club legend Steven Gerrard

Gerrard, who was part of the Liverpool side which narrowly missed out on the title in 2014 alongside Luis Suarez , wrote in his 2016 autobiography: ""Trent has a terrific chance of making it as a top professional...he's got a lovely frame and seems to have all the attributes you need.""

It's high praise, which the defender has used as inspiration.

""[Gerrard's] a hero, a legend, an icon, someone who I always looked up to, someone that I try to become and want to emulate,"" he said.

""I was just proud of him acknowledging my talents and singling me out individually as someone with a bright future. It was an honor for me...I always used him as an inspiration to become a better player.""

'We want to write our own chapter'

Since making his first-team debut in October 2016, he has gone from strength to strength and is now widely acknowledged as one of the best full-backs in the world.

Alexander-Arnold, though, doesn't want his or the club's relentless pursuit of success to stop here -- he wants to create a new legacy.

""When you're playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world and you're playing with world class players and you've got a world class manager the mentality has to be world class and that's relentless all the time.

""To be able to do that you have to win trophies year after year, and next year it's going to be about doing the same and recreating the feelings that we're feeling for the next few years and trying to become a legendary Liverpool team.

""We want to write our own chapter in this amazing history of the club -- we just want to be a special Liverpool team that fans can be proud of.""

The defender played an instrumental role in helping the club to win the UEFA Champions League in 2019

A voice for change and equality

His ambitions on the pitch are matched by those off it.

The defender has been inspired to speak out against racism by the impact of his England colleagues Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling.

During his side's recent Premier League clash with local rival Everton, Alexander-Arnold wore boots which carried the message 'Black Lives Matter.' These were auctioned off after the game with the proceeds going to the Nelson Mandela Foundation.

""The movement has been so inspiring to me, seeing so many people involved and so many people pick it up, so many movements and institutions that are behind it.

""It's powerful to be a part of something and to know that you're an inspiration and a role model to a younger generation. It just inspires you more to put out the right messages.""

And Alexander-Arnold knows that for meaningful change to happen education is the key.

""People shouldn't be treated differently because of the color of the skin or where they're from. So it's important to educate people.

""For now, it's about getting these types of stories and getting these types of messages out there as much as possible just to enforce that change and that education."""/['Aleks Klosok', 'Darren Lewis']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200626214357-trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-super-tease.jpg"

Iago Aspas' free kick in the 88th minute earned Celta a 2-2 draw after Suarez had twice given Barcelona the lead with assists from his pal Lionel Messi on both occasions.

The result means Barcelona moved ahead of Real Madrid by a point atop the standings but Los Blancos have played one fewer game and hold the advantage if the teams finish tied on points by virtue of having a better head-to-head record.

""We've got little margin for error now and in theory, we have to win all our games and hope our rival slips up,"" Barcelona manager Quique Setien was quoted as saying by Marca. ""We'll try to keep picking up maximum points.""

Barcelona's struggles at Vigo continued, having won only once in the league there since 2015.

Hamilton -- the lone Black driver in Formula 1 -- took to Instagram to reply to the comments made by the 89-year-old billionaire to CNN Sport on Friday.

"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/27/tennis/novak-djokovic-adria-tour-backlash-spt-intl/index.html"/Novak Djokovic: A week to forget for world No. 1 after exhibition tennis fiasco/"(CNN) Novak Djokovic should have been stepping out this Monday at Wimbledon, opening the Championships as the defending champion.

Instead, the top-ranked Serb is involved in a damage limitation exercise after his exhibition tour in the Balkans, intended to be an uplifting moment during the sport's hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic, was cancelled when Djokovic, his wife Jelena, three other players, three coaches and one player's pregnant wife tested positive for the virus.

Unlike other exhibition events during the pandemic, there was limited social distancing on the Adria Tour, which was played to crowded stadiums, with players hugging and high-fiving each other, playing basketball and dancing together.

""He hasn't had a good lockdown,"" British sports marketing expert Tim Crow put it bluntly in a phone interview with CNN Sport.

'Extremely happy'

When Djokovic announced in May he would host the Adria Tour, it seemed like tennis was slowly emerging from the shutdown, which had led to the first cancellation of Wimbledon since World War II.

The Adria Tour, which was scheduled to be played in four cities from June 13 through July 5, had attracted three-time grand slam finalist Dominic Thiem of Austria, world No. 7 Alexander Zverev of Germany and three-time major semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, among others. Djokovic's 24-year-old brother, Djordje, was named tournament director.

Speaking at a launch press conference on May 27, Djokovic said he was ""extremely happy"" to announce the series, organized by him and his family. He stressed ""absolutely all income"" from it would be going to humanitarian organizations, before proudly announcing that all the players would be playing for free.

He also said the tour would ""follow to and adhere to"" the local regulations and rules.

Belgrade party

When Djokovic played his first match against fellow Serb Viktor Troicki on the afternoon of Saturday June 13 in Belgrade, some 4,000 spectators had filled the stadium close to the Danube river to capacity, with few fans wearing masks. The players, good friends, hugged after Djokovic won in straight sets.

They also shook hands with the umpire, while ball kids handed them their towels. They took selfies with fans afterwards, and signed autographs.

Serbia and Croatia, neither of which experienced major virus outbreaks, had recently lifted many lockdown measures. But the Serbian government was still asking people to remain one meter apart. The lack of social distancing left many stunned.

""It is as if Coronavirus has passed?"" wrote former British No. 1 Greg Rusedski on Twitter two days later. ""How was this managed and why no concern for public social distancing and face masks. I know the figures in Serbia but why are they able to do this?""

The seemingly carefree nature of the event, which came a few days after a 20,000-strong crowd attended a soccer match in Belgrade, also surprised Crow, a former chief executive of London-based sports marketing agency Synergy.

""It was a screw-up,"" he said. ""As soon as you turned the TV on, you think, 'Hang on a second, what's going on here?' And unfortunately, we all know what happened.""

Also during that weekend, players including Djokovic, Thiem, Zverev and Dimitrov were filmed dancing in a packed Belgrade nightclub.

Behind closed doors

The limited social distancing at the Adria Tour was in sharp contrast to other exhibition events during the pandemic in the US, Germany, Britain and France, which were all held behind closed doors.

When Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams' long-time coach, wanted to host an event at his academy in the south of France during the lockdown, he reached out to the government. It sent him a long list of protocols, which he has implemented in his Ultimate Tennis Showdown series.

""I wanted to make sure to do it in a way where no one is at risk,"" Mouratoglou told CNN Sport in a phone interview on Friday.

These include all players being tested the day before each weekend's matches, no fans, no handshakes or ball-sharing between players, ball kids wearing gloves and masks and ample distance between every seat in the players' box.

Speaking at the ceremonial opening of the Adria Tour the day before his match against Troicki, Djokovic defended the limited social distancing of the crowd.

He emphasized Serbia had ""better numbers"" compared with other countries. According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Serbia has had 13,372 confirmed cases, including 264 deaths. Neighboring Croatia had registered 2,483 cases, including 107 deaths.

""You can also criticize us and say this is maybe dangerous but it's not up to me to make calls about what is right and wrong for health,"" Djokovic added. ""We are doing what the Serbian government is telling us.""

Dimitrov's bombshell

The next leg of the Adria Tour on June 20-21 once again attracted thousands of spectators, including Croatia Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, who briefly met Djokovic. Because Croatia had eased its lockdown measures before the event, players and fans didn't have to stick to social distancing rules.

Then came the bombshell announcement by Dimitrov on Sunday June 21 that he had tested positive for coronavirus.

The organizers swiftly canceled the entire series, while most of the other players were tested the same night. Then, on Monday, Croatia's Borna Coric confirmed he too had tested positive, while Zverev, former US Open winner Marin Cilic of Croatia and Russia's Andrey Rublev all tested negative but promised to self-isolate for 14 days as a precaution.

Troicki revealed he had tested positive soon after and then, on Tuesday, Djokovic confirmed that he, too, and his wife, Jelena, had done the same. Troicki's pregnant wife, Djokovic's fitness coach and Dimitrov's coach were also positive. Then on Friday, Djokovic's co-coach, Wimbledon winner Goran Ivanisevic, revealed he also tested positive.

Djokovic's mother Dijana told Serbian newspaper Blic that although the world No. 1 is positive it ""doesn't mean he is ill.""

""He is a young man and can bear it easier,"" she said. 'I also think this virus is close to the end so this seems just like a second wave of Corona, which is not as strong as in the beginning.""

""It is horrible, too horrible, what they write (international media), but we are used to it. It is like they couldn't wait for it (bad news) to happen. It is obvious that they have something against Novak.""

Condemnation

The condemnation was quick, with Australian player Nick Kyrgios labeling it a ""boneheaded decision"" to go ahead with the event. Britain's Andy Murray said that after seeing some of the pictures of the post-event party in Belgrade and of kids' day it was ""not surprising how many people had tested positive.""

The blame game was quickly in full flow, with Djokovic's father Srdjan pointing the finger at Dimitrov.

""Why did this happen? It is because the man (Dimitrov) has probably arrived ill from who knows where and then everything happened. Apparently he didn't test here but somewhere else and I don't think that that's right,"" the world No. 1's father told RTL Croatia.

""He caused major harm to you in Croatia, to us as a family and to us as Serbia,"" Djokovic's father added, continuing to point the finger at Dimitrov.

Dimitrov's agent didn't immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment, but he was widely quoted as telling other media that ""Grigor landed directly in Belgrade after three months of complete isolation. Neither in Belgrade (the first stop) nor later in Zadar was he offered or required to test for coronavirus.""

Reputational fallout?

This hasn't been Djokovic's only brush with controversy during the pandemic.

Shortly before the start of the Adria Tour, Djokovic, who is also president of the player council of the men's ATP Tour, angered some players by suggesting he may not take part in the US Open in New York at the end of August because organizers said they wanted to limit player entourages to just one extra person.

In April, he raised eyebrows for saying he was against the idea of having to be vaccinated for Covid-19 as a possible prerequisite to play on Tour again. And in May, he suggested during an Instagram Live that polluted water could be cleaned with positivity.

""He's always been an unconventional thinker,"" said Crow. ""That's part of his makeup.""

But Crow, who has worked with some of the world's biggest companies, doesn't think the collapse of the Adria Tour has damaged Djokovic's personal brand.

""It's not ideal but I think it's just a blip,"" said Crow. ""He did it with the best intentions and he realizes he has screwed up. And everyone screws up, every once in a while.""

Djokovic's representative hadn't responded to CNN's request for comment at the time of publication.

Djokovic made $33 million in the past year from corporate deals with seven sponsors, including racket manufacturer Head and French car maker Peugeot, according to Forbes

If it hadn't been for the virus, he may have been well on his way to tying or even surpassing both Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer as the most successful male player of all time.

When the sport shut down in March, Djokovic had won five of the last seven majors, taking his total tally to 17. That's just two shy of Nadal and three of Federer, who is out all season with a knee injury.

But instead of chasing his sixth Wimbledon title in the coming fortnight, Djokovic will spend most of it self-isolating with his family."/['Danielle Rossingh', 'For Cnn']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200626140640-djokovic-tease-super-tease.jpg"

Notably from Lewis Hamilton, a six-time world champion and the first and only Black driver to compete in F1, who has been a powerful voice following Floyd's death in Minneapolis last month.

Hamilton has joined protests , set up The Hamilton Commission to increase diversity in motorsport and called out F1's ""biggest stars"" for ""staying silent ... in the midst of injustice.""

For his part, Ecclestone, who was replaced as chief executive of Formula One in 2017 after nearly four decades in charge, praised how Hamilton has spoken out for equality.

""Lewis is a little bit special,"" Ecclestone told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""First, he's very, very, very talented as a driver and he seems to be now extremely talented when's he standing up and can make speeches.

""This last campaign he's doing for Black people is wonderful. He's doing a great job and it's people like that -- easily recognisable -- that people listen to.""

Bernie Ecclestone and Lewis Hamilton shake hands before the Mexico Grand Prix in 2015.

'Completely stupid taking all these statues down'

However, Ecclestone doesn't think incentives like The Hamilton Commission will have a tangible impact on the sport.

""I don't think it's going to do anything bad or good for Formula One,"" he said.

""It'll just make people think which is more important. I think that's the same for everybody. People ought to think a little bit and think: 'Well, what the hell. Somebody's not the same as White people and Black people should think the same about White people.'

""In lots of cases, Black people are more racist than what White people are.""

CNN challenged Ecclestone over the assertion and he was unable to provide any concrete evidence for the baseless claim beyond saying that he had ""noticed"" it over the years.

The 89-year-old continued by saying that changing attitudes towards race won't come ""easily,"" scorning the dismantling of statues of slave trade figures -- a move Hamilton backed when the statue of Edward Colston was torn down in the English city of Bristol.

""I think they need to start being taught at school,"" said Ecclestone.

""So they grow up not having to think about these things. I think it's completely stupid taking all these statues down. They should've left them there. Take the kids from school to look and say why they're there and what the people did and how wrong it was what they did.""

Later on Friday, F1 issued a statement on its website saying it ""completely disagreed with Bernie Ecclestone's comments that have no place in Formula 1 or society.

""Mr Ecclestone has played no role in Formula 1 since he left our organisation in 2017, his title Chairman Emeritus, being honorific, expired in January 2020.""

Bernie Ecclestone was in charge of F1 for nearly 40 years.

During his time at the helm of F1, Ecclestone brought in more races in new regions and attracted fresh interest in the sport.

The season preceding Liberty Media's $8 billion takeover in 2017 drew 400 million unique TV viewers across 200 territories. The 2016 championship saw 21 races in 21 countries and five continents.

In April, billionaire Ecclestone and wife Fabiana Flosi, 44, announced they were expecting a baby . Ecclestone's fourth child will be born this summer and when the announcement was made, he said he saw no difference ""between being 89 and 29.""

The Briton is no stranger to controversy.

In 2009 he praised Adolf Hitler for being ""able to get things done"" -- comments he later apologized for -- while he has also backed Vladimir Putin's controversial policy towards homosexuals and said that women should dress in white ""like all other domestic appliances.""

'Nobody's done anything'

Reigning world champion Hamilton recently referred to F1 as a ""white dominated sport,"" while the governing body has just launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative which seeks to fight the challenges of Covid-19 and condemn racism and inequality.

A task force has subsequently been set up to increase diversity and inclusion in F1, alongside a foundation to help finance internships and apprenticeships for under-represented groups.

Asked whether F1 should have done more to address the issue of diversity and inclusion, Ecclestone said: ""I don't think anyone bothered about it before.

""I think it's an important issue, but it's been there so long [and] nobody's done anything. Why didn't someone do something two or three years ago?

""They're too busy trying to win races or find sponsors or something.""

In a recent article for The Times , Hamilton alluded to an incident in Spain in 2008 when he was taunted by fans in blackface.

Ecclestone was criticized for not taking the situation seriously, although he later said that he spoke to Hamilton's father Anthony and that ""everything [was] fine.""

""I'm surprised that it concerns him,"" said Ecclestone reflecting on the incident, adding that he never spoke to Hamilton himself, who was driving for McLaren at the time.

""I'm really unhappy if he took it seriously. I never thought he did. I didn't think it affected him.

""I don't know why the people did all of that anyway. Was it against him personally or what they thought?""

Hamilton celebrates winning last year's driver's championship.

Ribbs' near-breakthrough

As owner of racing team Brabham, Ecclestone invited Willie T. Ribbs to test drive in Portugal in 1986, an audition for a place on the grid which could have seen the American become F1's first Black driver.

In a recent interview with CNN Sport anchor Davies, Ribbs, who went on to compete in IndyCar and NASCAR, spoke of Ecclestone in glowing terms.

""He wanted me in the car. He wanted me in Formula One [...] His sponsors at the time were Italian. They wanted Italian drivers, and I totally respect him. I have no issues with that.

""My goal was to be in Formula One, but Bernie Ecclestone made a statement because Bernie Ecclestone put the first man of color, first Black man, in a Formula 1 car.""

It is with a resolve to increase diversity within the sport that the new F1 season gets underway.

""For me as a coach, my job is to make sure that we get through that period without massive problems.""

"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/25/football/liverpool-premier-league-title-spt-intl-gbr/index.html"/Liverpool wins English Premier League for the first time in club's history/"(CNN) Liverpool has had to wait longer than anyone could have predicted, but the club can once again call itself the best in England.

There have been years in the wilderness, a few near-misses and, just when Jurgen Klopp and his men were six points from securing the club's first league title in 30 years, a global pandemic brought this season's procession to a halt.

But the return of football in England earlier this month after a 100-day absence revived a title bid which was only put in doubt when the season was put on pause.

After Liverpool's impressive 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on Wednesday, Manchester City needed to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Thursday to delay the coronation. But the defending champion's failure to claim three points -- City was beaten 2-1 in London -- ended the wait. Pep Guardiola's team must now pass on the crown.

Liverpool, a team which had previously won 18 league titles but none since 1990, has now won the English Premier League for the first time, taking it to within one title of equaling Manchester United's record of 20 first division titles.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Klopp described winning the title as ""absolutely incredible.""

""I have no words. It's unbelievable. Much more than I ever thought would be possible,"" he said. ""Becoming champions with this club is absolutely incredible. It is an incredible achievement of my players ... and a pure joy for me to coach them.""

Fans celebrate outside Anfield.

Though lockdown restrictions are easing in England, Liverpool fans will not be able to celebrate as they had envisioned a few months ago. Who knows when it will be safe to hold a parade through the city?

A number of supporters gathered outside Anfield to rejoice in their team's historic achievement, while the squad itself were together to enjoy the moment the final whistle blew in Stanford Bridge.

But the more subdued celebrations do not mask the enormity of the feat.

What Klopp and his team have achieved is remarkable. Defeated just once, Liverpool has been the dominant team of the season. The Merseysiders lead second-place City by 23 points and, by the end of the campaign, could amass a record points total of 107. No team has won the title with seven games to spare.

Liverpool fans celebrate their team winning the Premier League title outside Anfield.

When Klopp joined the club in October 2015, Liverpool was 10th in the table, struggling to score goals and had collected 12 points from eight games. There were wealthier teams, better teams, in the EPL. Thoughts of winning another league title seemed fanciful.

""We have to change from doubters to believers,"" said Klopp in his first interview as Liverpool boss. It was a statement which raised eyebrows, but one which also energized the club's enormous fanbase. Few could have imagined, however, the progress the club would make under the charismatic German.

There have been expensive signings; record fees for a goalkeeper and a defender, but even before those purchases were made, Klopp's tactics had resulted in progress. Now, no team in the country plays with such intensity and energy. It has the best defense in the league, a hypnotic forward triumvirate and a tireless midfield.

In every season but his first, the manager has steered his team into the Champions League, reaching the final twice, and every player under his tutelage has improved, from academy graduates such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, to more surprising signings like Mo Salah and Andy Robertson. There have been few flops.

And, finally, after three failures in cup finals, Liverpool won its first silverware under Klopp last season, when the team beat Tottenham in the Champions League final.

It was a victory which strengthened the fans' faith in the team, easing concerns that this was a squad of nearly-men, as Liverpool had also that season narrowly missed out on the title by a point, despite accumulating a club record total of 97.

Since that summer night in Madrid, the team has gone on to win the Club World Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and now the most coveted trophy of all.

That Liverpool would bounce back from last season's agony to win the title the following season in such ruthless fashion is testimony to the team Klopp has built. But, as the man himself once said, the players he has assembled are ""mentality monsters.""

Klopp has earned the right to be regarded among the finest managers in this storied club's history. It is not without reason that many liken him to Bill Shankly, the former manager who rebuilt the club in the 1960s and laid the foundations for what became a footballing dynasty in the following two decades.

""He's been fantastic and epitomizes everything the club stands for,"" Kenny Dalglish, the last manager to guide Liverpool to the title, told BT Sport after a Christian Pulisic strike and a Willian penalty had secured victory for Chelsea.

""It's not just a one-off because last year they came within a point. Onwards and upwards and, I think, we've a lot more happy days to look forward to as long as Jurgen is there.""

But UK authorities are concerned that such activities could be lethal during a pandemic.

The British government has pleaded with the public to continue observing social distancing guidelines after thousands packed England's beaches on Thursday and thousands more celebrated Liverpool's first championship in 30 years outside the club's Anfield stadium.

Officials in southern England declared a ""major incident"" Thursday after crowds flocked to beaches in Bournemouth and Sandbanks, Dorset on the hottest day of 2020 so far.

The area was overrun with cars and sunbathers, leading to gridlock and the local council handed out 558 parking enforcement fines -- a daily record.

Garbage crews also suffered abuse and intimidation as they tried to remove mountains of waste from the seafront and there were a number of incidents involving excessive alcohol and fighting.

""We want people to enjoy outside spaces and we want them to enjoy leisure facilities such as the beach but we also don't want to see case numbers go up again, so we are asking people to obey social distancing guidelines,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said Friday.

The UK government will consider closing the beaches if there is a ""spike in infections,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned in an interview with British Talk Radio on Thursday evening.

""If we see a spike in the number of cases then we will take action,"" the cabinet minister said.

Hancock asked the public to ""keep following the social distancing [advice],"" which remains in place ""for a reason.""

""The virus doesn't respect the fact that it's a hot summer's day, the virus spreads from social contact,"" he said.

Visitors enjoy the summer heatwave at the beach on Thursday in Bournemouth, on England's south coast.

""That's why we've still got social distancing in place"" he added.

Hancock urged English people not to throw ""away all that good work"" but added he was reluctant to close beaches as ""people have had a pretty tough lockdown.""

Britain is in the process of easing its lockdown restrictions, which have been in place since March.

Groups of up to six people can now meet outside in England. But on Friday Downing Street warned that if coronavirus case numbers increased, the government would put local lockdowns in place.

Clashes break out at street parties

Several unlicensed street parties have also posed challenges for police officers.

On Thursday evening objects were thrown at officers at the scene of a block party in Notting Hill, west London, the city's Metropolitan Police force said. The crowd was dispersed at about 2 a.m. local time.

There was another ""unlicensed music event"" at Streatham Common in South London on Thursday, which Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick described as ""quite a large gathering.""

On Wednesday, 22 officers were injured as they tried to clear an illegal street party in Brixton, south London.

Dick said nearly 140 officers had been injured in the last two weeks, as they responded to disturbances at street parties and during flare-ups of violence at far-right rallies and the Black Lives Matter protests in London.

""It's hot -- some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive, some people are plain violent. We will be prepared this weekend, we have officers all over London working hard to keep the peace and to protect our public from violence and disorder,"" Dick said on Friday.

""These events are unlawful, there shouldn't be happening,"" Dick said of the parties. ""We have a duty to close them down and disperse them. The local communities hate them, incredibly antisocial behavior, very noisy, during a pandemic, sometimes violence, and for our officers who are simply doing their duty, to be attacked in that manner is utterly unacceptable.""

The police commissioner said that she was on the streets of London on Thursday night, when the police got a call saying there was a man with a machete at one of the illegal gatherings.

""I think you can see immediately that a beach is a completely different scenario from a street in London, where you have hundreds of residents ringing up, terrified by what they are seeing and saying please come police and break this up now because we know there's going to be violence,"" Dick said.

England's beaches and unlicensed parties weren't the only reason for Thursday's crowds.

Anfield crowds cause concern

Thousands of Liverpool fans gathered outside the club's Anfield stadium, after Chelsea's 2-1 win over Manchester City on Thursday handed the Merseyside club its first league title since 1990.

Supporters set off flares and fireworks, singing all the while, resulting in Merseyside Police closing off roads around the stadium at approximately 11 p.m. UK time, and advising motorists to ""avoid the area.""

And although Assistant Chief Constable Rob Carden thanked the ""overwhelming majority of fans"" for recognizing that ""now is not the time to gather together to celebrate,"" he urged fans to avoid congregating and celebrate in their ""social bubble.""

""Unfortunately, as we have seen throughout the lockdown period, not everyone adhered to the regulations in place. Although the vast majority of celebrations were good natured, a large number of people chose to gather outside the stadium,"" Carden said in a statement

""In the days ahead, we urge supporters to do the right thing and celebrate safely with members of your household and in your social bubble. By doing this you keep yourself, your family, friends and neighbours safe.

""As we all know, Merseyside has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and we must all do what we can to prevent further cases and deaths in our communities.""

The joint bid had been favorite to win after Japan withdrew from the process earlier this month, leaving Colombia as the only competition.

FIFA's technical evaluation on all three hosts had put the Trans-Tasman bid way ahead of its rival, giving it a score of 4.1 out of five.

Japan was awarded 3.9, partly prompting its withdrawal, whilst Colombia scored only 2.8.

For Fabio Wibmer though, once he's finished washing his clothes, white goods provide the perfect obstacle for his next trick.

The Austrian cycling sensation, whose videos have garnered him a huge following on Instagram and YouTube, has been pedaling furiously during lockdown.

Whereas he previously used railings and walls in cities across the world for his stunts, the 24-year-old is making the most of what he's got at home for his videos.

His ""Home Office"" video, which was viewed over 1.6 million times in one day and now has over seven million views, involves Wibmer performing tricks all around his house using household appliances and sporting equipment as props.

Wibmer describes riding his bike at home as a ""weird situation.""

For Wibmer and his housemates, the ability to focus on producing this video and ""thinking outside the box"" has helped him pass the time while he's been stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic

""I was walking through the house and through the garage. And then, for example, I saw my bike like standing. And then I thought this could be actually cool to jump on it,"" Wibmer told CNN Sport.

""We really, really enjoyed it because we had a rhythm, kind of like a mission to do something and we found our passion in that time.

""I think the whole team was super happy to be in such a situation where we can still do something at home rather than just sitting in the home and watching Netflix or whatever.""

Wibmer balances on the outside of a window of his house.

Adapting to the surroundings

Wibmer starting riding when he was six and has traveled all over the world to film stunts from the streets of Paris and Hamburg to Tenerife and Vancouver.

Given that global lifestyle, being told he had to stay home in Austria was ""super crazy"" for Wibmer.

""I was there with my roommates and then we just thought, 'well, let's make the most out of it and just try to be creative and do something.' And so I had to bring my biking playground from the streets and from the mountains to my home.""

To Wibmer a bike isn't just for riding ...

""For a guy like me, I'm used to playing outside on my bike and riding my bike everywhere else, but not at home. I didn't really know what to do in the beginning because usually I don't ride at home.""

Even for someone as experienced as Wibmer, some of the stunts that feature in the video took numerous attempts to perfect.

Wibmer says that he tried the basketball trick shot, where he uses his bike's back wheel to hit the ball into the hoop, around ""600 times.""

""I think out of those 600 tries we had, maybe 10 tries kind of went into that direction, but they're definitely not in the basket.

""I mean we didn't really have any stress, so it was actually more chill. It took us around four or five weeks in total to get everything.""

Wibmer jumps from the roof of his house onto a tree.

'Inspire'

Wibmer's stunts have helped him become one of the best-known riders on the biking scene, with his videos raking in over 700 million views. His ""Wibmer's Law"" video has been viewed over 83 million times.

His rise in popularity has also been accompanied by a developing awareness of his ability to inspire people in the biking community.

Wibmer somersault's off his house.

""With my riding and my passion to biking, I can inspire a lot of people and a lot of kids, which is really cool,"" Wibmer explains.

The septet of British parkour specialists have amassed over 600 million views on YouTube and even worked on a Hollywood film.

The group, which started on 10/10/10, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and over the last decade has filmed around the world, from Seoul to Madrid (a favorite destination). But with the world in lockdown changes have had to be made.

They should be in Nepal filming, but are instead searching for ways to create content from home.

Living separately, Storror members have been filming videos on their own and then editing the footage together. But making engaging content for their fans while not encouraging them to break lockdown rules is a fine line.

""I think that's part of this whole maturity thing and learning to understand our responsibility, like we're taking the lockdown seriously,"" Drew Taylor, professional parkour athlete and Storror member, told CNN Sport

The seven members of Storror.

While mastering parkour has come through years of training, the group -- which includes Taylor, Toby Segar, Sacha Powell, Joshua Burnett Blake, Callum Powell and founders, Max and Benj Cave -- has also put on workshops for groups of refugees

""I think most of us can agree we've kind of overshot even our greatest expectations of what we wanted to do with this when we were a kid,"" added Taylor.

A member of Storror looks down at the streets below.

Moving up in the world

Last year the group worked on the set of a Hollywood movie after being invited by award-winning Hollywood director Michael Bay -- also director of the 'Transformers' trilogy and the 'Bad Boys' films -- to assist in the filming of '6 Underground,' his Netflix film starring Ryan Reynolds and Dave Franco.

They were given the freedom to instruct experienced cameramen as they saw fit, while also serving as actors' stunt doubles.

During their time on set, the group also performed stunts on famous sites, such as the Florence Cathedral, while also training other actors in the basics of parkour.

Toby Segar jumps between objects.

Working on a Hollywood movie set was ""affirmation that we were moving in the right direction,"" Segar, one of Storror's members, told CNN Sport.

""It was skipping a lot of steps in the movie industry, in terms of learning about how they do it,"" Segar said.

""It was a really crazy position to be in, where we have control over these scenes and we have control over certain elements of this blockbuster movie. But it was great for the entire team.""

A member of Storror flips in between two buildings.

Taking a toll

But in creating the jaw-dropping videos, bodies have been pushed to the limit -- which has consequences.

Segar -- the 2015 winner of 'Ninja Warrior UK' -- recalled knocking his four front teeth out and breaking his collarbone, while Taylor has broken his ankle.

Segar climbs up the side of a building.

""I guess that's why we're still doing it after 14 years is because those kind of things happen so rarely that it's worth all the reward and how much it's improved our lives, like the physical benefits of the exercise or the friends that we've met through it,"" Taylor -- a world record holder for the longest front flip -- explained.

""The sense of reward and achievement you get from doing all these crazy things ...

The renowned adventurer and filmmaker has spent the past 20 years traveling the world, pushing himself to conquer one historic challenge after another, and engaging in the sort of daring activities that would be beyond many people's imaginations.

Whether it's climbing Everest or filming the Oscar-winning Free Solo, the 46-year-old has captured the full extent of human endeavor.

""When you're pushing for cutting-edge expeditions, you're often in close proximity to potential disaster,"" he told CNN Sport. ""You're constantly managing risk and you're in fairly serious situations all the time, so your senses are very sharpened.""

But Chin's intrepid way of life has been put on hold as the world comes to grips with the coronavirus pandemic. To a certain degree, his past expeditions have readied him for such uncertain times and, he said, he hoped others could learn from his experiences.

""This is a moment to pause, reevaluate and think about what's important,"" he added.

Jimmy Chin has photographed all around the world.

Early years

As a film director and National Geographic photographer, Chin has assembled a world-class portfolio of work. This year he returned from a trip to Antarctica, where he and a team of adventurers skied two new routes down the tallest and second-tallest peaks on the continent.

But such a life wasn't always the plan.

As a child growing up in rural Minnesota, Chin was encouraged to pursue more traditional aspirations: excelling academically, as well as in martial arts and as a competitive swimmer.

But it was skiing on a small hill behind his house that he found freedom. ""If I did well in everything else, I got to ski,"" he said.

Already with a taste for the world of outdoor sports, Chin was introduced to climbing at college. At that point, he said, it was game over as the sport became a vehicle to see the world and explore places that made his ""heart sing.""

He moved to Yosemite National Park where he worked odd jobs to fund his nomadic lifestyle, eventually picking up a camera and starting to shoot.

""I have so many incredible photographer friends who had a really noble vision for being an artist with their photography,"" he laughed.

""But my whole entry into it was just 'if I take these photos and I sell them I can make a little money so I can keep climbing.'""

His adventures have often involved very high stakes.

Capturing the impossible

Since he himself is a professional climber, Chin's photography services have been that much more in demand over the years, with the relationship between him and his subjects an important element of his success.

""If they're going to be doing this thing, and you're the only one documenting, they've got to trust that you're going to get it,"" he said. ""Then I have to trust that the athlete isn't just doing it for the camera.""

Such a collaboration was put to the ultimate test in perhaps his finest, and most daring, work to date.

Alongside his wife Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, Chin documented Alex Honnold's astonishing free solo climb up El Capitan in 2017.

Chin assembled a team of world-class climbers to help film Honnold ascend the 3,200-foot vertical rock face without a single safety rope.

Working together, they plotted where the cameras would be positioned on the wall so as to not distract Honnold on the day.

The historic feat won the team an Academy Award for Best Documentary at a ceremony that will live long in Chin's memory.

""My confidence in Alex [Honnold] and his capacity to execute was very, very high,"" said Chin, who had known Honnold for around 10 years before his death-defying ascent.

""I had seen him in very difficult situations before, completely unfazed, and I also knew that he's the most calculated person I know. He's not going to go do it if he's not ready.""

Dealing with fear

Despite his years of experience, Chin said watching his friend train for and complete the climb was an ordeal.

""The fear was less acute than I think people might have perceived; it was more of a long-term dread,"" he said, now able to laugh at the thought.

""I felt like it was on my shoulders for almost three years, from when we conceived of the project to filming it with him.

""Every day, whether he was free-soloing or not, there's a potential for somebody to get hurt or die because you're in these environments.""

Dealing with uncertainty is an occupational hazard for Chin and although meticulous planning can help iron out some of the danger, managing fear itself is essential to coping with the unexpected. Remaining calm, avoiding emotional decisions, can often be the difference between life and death.

""You have [to] step outside of yourself and be objective about a situation and make very objective decisions,"" he said.

Chin has embarked on climbing and skiing adventures.

Lockdown lessons

Though still working at home on a number of projects, it has taken a once-in-a-century event like the global pandemic to finally slow Chin down. He is now at least able to enjoy time with his young family.

""I'm just out in the yard playing with the kids, usually a rarity for me,"" he said, acknowledging these were the most consecutive days he'd spent with his four-and six-year-old children.

""I don't get that much time to hang out with them so I've been running around the yard and having fun.""

Living in a rural area means Chin is able to leave his house while still abiding by social distancing guidelines, a must for someone whose mental and physical well-being is ""tied"" to going into the wilderness.

He is a man who, in more ordinary times, usually searches for solitude, reveling in having time to think and ask existential questions. ""It's good to think about them,"" he said.

It is not the sort of life many would choose, Chin admitted, but he hoped people in lockdown could learn from his experiences.

The club managed to end its 30-year wait thanks to Chelsea's 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Stamford Bridge in London.

The champions of Europe are now English Premier League winners, guided to the summit by their gregarious German manager, the bespectacled man-hugger extraordinaire who has captivated the city and the club.

Liverpool's transformation has been extraordinary. Few thought that the club which once ruled English football for such a prolonged period that it became dynastic would ever again wear the crown. Decades of disappointment and false hope had lowered expectations. Even optimists had become skeptics. By the time Jurgen Klopp took charge, the empire had long since fallen

When Klopp succeeded Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool boss in October 2015, the team was 10th in the table and had been thumped 3-0 at home by West Ham that season. Twenty-five years had gone by since the club last won a league title and another championship felt as elusive as the unicorn.

The scars of almost winning the title in 2014 had not healed and key members of that team were gone. Steven Gerrard had moved to Los Angeles, Luis Suarez to Barcelona

But the charismatic German with the extra-large personality promised change and raised the decibels. Though it has taken him five years to win English football's biggest prize, Klopp's impact on Liverpool was immediate.

""We have to change from doubters to believers. Now,"" were his striking words in his first interview as the club's new manager. Even before he had overseen his first match, his charm and positivity gave weary fans hope.

Klopp is unveiled as Liverpool's new manager during a press conference at Anfield on October 9, 2015.

The man from the Black Forest was held in higher esteem than the Liverpool players he had inherited. Having taken over Borussia Dortmund when the club was mid-table and financially hampered, he had twice guided the club to the Bundesliga title, including a league and cup double in the 2011-12 season.

His then new tactics of high, concentrated pressing all over the pitch had not only turned Dortmund into winners, but had gained admirers all over the world.

""When he signed, all the fellas from work, we couldn't believe it, because he was bigger than the club at the time, he was bigger and more well-known than any player we had,"" Dan Fieldsend, author of ""Local: a club and its city. Liverpool's social history,"" tells CNN Sport.

""His words were perfect, like poetry. This is a city of dreamers. So, when he [Klopp] said my aim is to get Liverpool to the top of the table in five years and to win a trophy in three years, that was just everything we'd longed to hear for a long time.

""Klopp was more far-sighted than even the fans at the time. The board as well, they had a vision. That philosophy of never accepting second best, we had kind of forgotten as a fanbase.""

Klopp is tossed in the air by his players after winning the league title at the end of the Bundesliga match between Dortmund and FC Nuernberg on April 30, 2011.

Despite his passion, his words and his past successes, the task before Klopp was Herculean. The opposition was extraordinarily wealthy, and better than his team. There were also question marks over whether Klopp's high-octane tactics could succeed in a league where there was no winter break.

Liverpool's was a squad which clearly needed to improve, but In Klopp's first game in charge, against Tottenham, the team at least played with more energy -- running further than they had in any other match that season -- and there was one detail he could quickly affect, regardless of the personnel at his disposal: the Anfield atmosphere.

The man who can gesticulate as wildly on the sidelines as a broken windmill in a storm sought first to energize the supporters.

""Sometimes, he almost challenges the fans,"" John Gibbons, contributor to the podcast Anfield Wrap, tells CNN. ""He's probably told us off more than any other Liverpool manager. He's headmastery in a way, but he's a headmaster you want to please.""

It was after a 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, his first loss as Liverpool boss, that Klopp told the assembled media that he felt ""pretty alone"" at the sight of Liverpool fans leaving after Palace's 82nd-minute winner.

A month later, following an inauspicious 2-2 draw with West Brom, Klopp and his players saluted the Anfield crowd, which garnered some sneering from observers unable to fathom why scrambling a draw to lowly West Brom was worth celebrating. Klopp would reveal that he wanted to thank the fans for the ""best atmosphere since I came here.""

""He got stick for it,"" says Gibbons of that West Brom celebration. ""But he was saying to the Kop 'this is what happens when we all stick to together, the players will keep going if you do.'

""There's something about him that you trust. He's a leader and he'd be a leader in whatever he decided to do. He could run a bank and he'd be brilliant.""

Klopp (2L) leads his players in saluting the crowd after drawing against West Bromwich Albion at Anfield on December 13, 2015.

It was Christian Heidel's gut instinct which launched a career which now not only consists of Bundesliga titles and a Champions League trophy, but a historic Premier League title, too.

With Mainz desperate not to drop to the third tier of German football, in February 2001 Heidel, the club's then sporting director, offered Klopp the chance to go from player to coach. Klopp was studying for a degree in sports business at Goethe University when he secured his first full-time contract as a player, aged 23 at Mainz, but had no managerial experience.

Heidel has since said it was a decision ""made with the stomach and not the head."" Klopp was not the captain of the team but was, said Heidel, its ""emotional leader.""

Eight weeks into the job, Klopp had secured Mainz's safety and, in the years that followed, took the club and its fans on an unforgettable journey, culminating in promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history.

Klopp celebrates promotion as Mainz manager.

Several influences shaped Klopp: his mentor Wolfgang Franks, the late Mainz coach, whose tactical path Klopp followed; his father Norbert, a traveling salesman and former amateur goalkeeper, who instilled in him a love of sport, while his Mainz teammates are said to have upheld his belief that hard work and intelligence can compensate for a lack of skill.

In Raphael Honigstein's book ""Klopp Bring The Noise,"" Peter Krawietz, Klopp's second assistant coach at Liverpool, said Klopp learned an ""incredible amount about the thing that make a football team tick"" at Mainz.

""He's taken all these years in the dressing room, reflected on them and found that many things can be sorted with a bit of common sense. He has a feel for the situation, for saying the right thing at the right moment in the right manner,"" said Krawietz.

It was his captivating manner which made him a successful football analyst for German broadcaster ZDF during the 2006 World Cup in his home country. Still a second division coach and someone who had not won a significant trophy as either player or manager, he nevertheless connected with the audience.

Lutz Pfannenstiel, analyst for ZDF for the 2010 World Cup, has shared a television studio with Klopp and is not surprised his former colleague has become a success in England.

""He's extremely passionate, extremely direct, extremely funny,"" Pfannenstiel, sporting director at Fortuna Dusseldorf, tells CNN Sport. ""He's obviously very emotional but when he talks about football he doesn't try to be a smart-arse. He always says it how it is, what you see is what you get. He has that unbelievable skill to motivate people.

""He's the exact opposite of arrogant. He's like a general. In the film ""Gladiator,"" whenever the guy put up his sword and said, 'we're going to a war now,' they would just blindly follow him. That's somehow what he is without a sword.""

There is a German word for people like Klopp: Menschenfanger, someone who can talk people into doing things they themselves did not feel possible. It is why players take to heart his all-or-nothing approach and why fans would no longer countenance giving up on the team if they needed an improbable number of goals in the dying minutes of a match.

""Everyone likes being told they're important and Jurgen is really good at that. He tells the players how brilliant they are but also us, so you turn up at Anfield feeling like you're a participant,"" says Gibbons.

Klopp celebrates with the Champions League trophy at Estadio Wanda Metropolitano on June 1, 2019.

""I give everything. I expect my players to give everything. Then we see what we get. That creates the mentality of the team,"" said Klopp in a recent interview.

Klopp has been given time and the funds to succeed at Anfield, and the fans were patient because they had faith.

Though Liverpool did not instantly challenge for the league under him -- in his first season the team finished eighth -- each year there was progress; in the players bought, in the manner they played and in league positions: eighth, fourth, fourth, second, first.

There has been some angst -- Klopp lost three finals with Liverpool before winning the Champions League last year, his first silverware as Liverpool manager. And when Liverpool missed out on the title last season by a point there were those who wondered whether Klopp and his team could rebound from such agonizing failure.

The team's response was emphatic and a 30-year wait has been ended by a commanding margin. The man who gives everything asked his players and fans to match his mentality and everyone has reaped the rewards."/['Aimee Lewis']/2020-06-25 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200625115534-klopp-tease-super-tease.jpg"
"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/23/tennis/bianca-andreescu-us-open-2020-spt-intl/index.html"/US Open champion Bianca Andreescu wants to 'surpass Serena'/"(CNN) Tennis star Bianca Andreescu says she hopes to one day surpass the greatest players of all-time as she prepares to defend her title at this year's US Open.

The 20-year-old became Canada's first-ever grand slam singles champion when she defeated Serena Williams in straight sets at Flushing Meadows last year but the youngster is far from content with her achievements to date.

Her aim is simple: To be the best in the world and to break records in the process.

""I want to surpass Serena [Williams] and her wins. Maybe even Chrissy Evert, who knows? Margaret Court,"" she told CNN Sport.

""I like to dream big; it gives me more motivation to actually step on the court and continue doing what I'm doing.""

Andreescu celebrates during the US Open in 2019.

On being the best

The youngster has quite some way to go before reaching the levels of Evert, Williams and Court -- who have 18, 23 and 24 titles respectively -- but her US Open win last year showed she's on the right track.

The pressure that follows such a triumph sits comfortably on such young shoulders. After all, as she says, she delivers her best under pressure.

""Everything I do, I always give 150% and I always want to be the best at it,"" she said. ""For my tennis career I put in so much effort and sacrificed a lot, so I want to be the best.

""Surpassing those players would make me the best but whatever God has in store for me.""

Andreescu reacts after beating Serena Williams in the US Open final.

Return of tennis

Like the rest of the tour, Andreescu has been out of action for a number of weeks with tennis postponed amid the coronavirus pandemic.

However, with restrictions beginning to ease across North America, this year's US Open is scheduled to begin on August 31, and the Canadian is desperate to defend her title.

Many high-profile players have raised concerns about staging the event so soon but Andreescu is confident the tournament will be safe behind closed doors.

""I actually didn't think tennis would come back so soon just because it's such an international sport but, honestly, I'm just super happy to go back there and hopefully defend my title,"" she said.

""I know everyone involved is going to do their best to keep everyone as safe as possible. Just looking at all the other sports, I think it's time for tennis to come back.""

US Open 2020

Although tennis will be back, it promises to look very different.

Perhaps the biggest change will be the lack of spectators in the stands, something which Andreescu knows will take some getting used to.

Fans played a huge part in her winning her maiden grand slam in 2019, with the majority of the crowd supporting Williams on the night.

As it turned out, the partisan reception was all the motivation she needed.

""Playing in front of the crowd just brings the hype into everything. I would say I perform really good under pressure so I felt the crowd gave me a push,"" she said, adding that this year's tournament will feel very different.

""There will definitely be people watching at home so it would be good to keep that in the back of our minds.""

Andreescu is looking forward to defending her US Open title this year.

Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that ""extraordinary precautions"" would be in place to ensure safety at the tournament, including ""robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing and transportation.""

However, ensuring families were able to travel with players throughout the entirety of the tournament was a major factor in players agreeing to the plans, according to WTA President Micky Lawler.

""Coming over would have been a big commitment because you're here for three to four weeks. So being here with just one person was a non-starter for people with families, so it ended up in a better place for those players that expressed concerns,"" Lawler told CNN Sport.

The decision to permit more people in a player's entourage appeared to satisfy the needs of star players such as Williams, who has now stated her intention to participate.

Her inclusion, along with defending champion Andreescu, was a huge boost to organizers.

""She [Williams] is an iconic athlete beyond tennis. Her voice carries tremendous influence, so to get an endorsement from Serena was very important, it was huge,"" added Lawler, saying the WTA would continue working closely with its medical partners to ensure players safety.

'Balancing act'

All being well, Lawler hopes the US Open will be a symbol of hope for tennis but admits the current schedule is far from perfect.

Initial plans for the tournament had no space for mixed doubles, wheelchair tennis or the junior competition, but it appears the United States Tennis Association (USTA) may reassess the inclusion of wheelchair tennis after heavy criticism.

""This is a really difficult balancing act and the easiest thing would have been to say 'let's just call it quits and forget about 2020',"" she said.

""But that would have come at a massive cost to everyone -- players, tournaments and the whole sport.

""So kudos to the USTA for working this hard to come up with a plan that offers a great opportunity to a lot of people. Is it a perfect plan? Absolutely not."""/['Ben Church', 'Christina Macfarlane', 'Cnn Video Ursin Caderas']/2020-06-23 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200622155600-andreescu-tease-super-tease.jpg"
"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/24/football/marta-emotional-world-cup-speech-one-year-later-spt-intl/index.html"/Marta's emotional World Cup speech resonates even more one year on/"With tears in her eyes, Marta, arguably the greatest ever women's soccer player, pleaded with not only her country, but the entire world after Brazil's round of 16 loss to France in the 2019 Women's World Cup.

""There's not going to be a Formiga forever, there's not going to be a Marta forever, there's not going to be a Cristiane,"" she added, naming a number of Brazil's more experienced players who are coming to the end of their careers.

Marta, the six-time FIFA World Player of the Year, and the most prolific scorer in World Cup finals history -- men's or women's with 17 goals -- has never lifted the World Cup trophy or had a gold medal draped around her neck at the Olympics.

When the final whistle blew on their 2-1 loss in extra-time to hosts France, eliminating them from the World Cup, Brazil's players fell to the pitch crying. Marta took note.

Kathellen of Brazil looks dejected following the France defeat.

Speaking to CNN Sport through a translator Marta said, ""I did not plan the speech. I saw my teammates crying. There was a lot of big emotions. I felt the need to share a message that would show them and to show the young athletes the path to follow.""

Looking straight down the camera, Marta continued her speech from the pitch of Stade Océane. ""We're asking for support; you have to cry at the beginning so you can smile at the end.""

Reflecting on her speech, Marta told CNN Sport: ""Every time that I can, I try to make a difference. I want to show everyone, boys and girls, it doesn't matter the gender, that it is possible. And I do this with love. I have to be a leader on and off the field. My life is moved by this. I take this responsibility with a good heart and dedication. It is a great responsibility to have.""

Amanda Kestelman, a journalist with Brazilian outlet Globo Esporte, has seen the challenges the team faced not just in France, but through generations.

""I think everyone in Brazil got really emotional. We don't use the huge talent of Marta to make the women's game as big in Brazil as much as it should be. I used to call them the force of nature, because they made a lot with not so many resources,"" Kestelman told CNN Sport. ""They got far with little, but they can't stay forever. We need to look for the future.""

Marta is a six-time FIFA World Player of the Year.

Kestleman added: ""The Marta speech was the one everyone saw because it was broadcasting all over the world but talking with those women after the game, they had the same feeling. They were talking to us saying, 'please clubs, federation, don't forget us. Don't remember us just in the Olympics, in the World Cup.""

Financial Disparity

Marta, who plays for the Orlando Pride in the NWSL in the United States, knows the women's game in Brazil needs help at a bigger, more national level.

""Men's soccer is still the religion in Brazil. You are born wearing a men's team jersey. When you're born, your father picks this team for you. But now people are starting to support the women's soccer. And, of course, there's also the financial difference.""

The financial difference is no small matter. Brazil lacks a substantial national women's league, instead relying on a tournament style competition, and most women's clubs are supported through their larger, more profitable men's sides. Now with the spread of Covid-19 ravaging the country , the future of the women's game is much more in doubt.

""This pandemic is bringing us a couple of uncertainties, especially financially, especially for the clubs without a men's team to support them, because we're not sure about what the future holds,"" said Marta.

Kestelman agrees that it's becoming a serious financial issue considering Brazilian clubs haven't played a game, men's or women's, since early March due to the pandemic, and there is no end in sight.

Despite the concerns, Marta added: ""I do believe that each year the exposure of women's soccer in Brazil has been improving.""

Improvements take time, and money. According to Kestelman the disparity in funding from the Brazilian Football Confederation, or CBF, between the men's and women's teams is huge.

A recent report by Globo Esporte found the CBF gave out a line of credit of 3.7 million Brazilian reais (roughly 702,400 US Dollars) to support women's clubs across two divisions during the pandemic. By comparison, almost 100 million Brazilian reais were loaned out to the men's clubs in just the first division alone.

""It's a lack of investment for sure. And that's not just a problem in Brazil; we are talking about a problem in the whole of South America,"" Kestelman noted.

One of those countries, Colombia, is in the running to host the 2023 Women's World Cup and will learn its fate when the winning bid is announced on Thursday.

Brazil's player Marta stands facing the Brazilian crowd.

Enduring Legacy

If the last image we saw of Marta on the World Cup stage was one imploring the young women of her country to dedicate themselves to advancing the women's game, then that would be a fitting final moment for a global icon of the sport.

When asked what she wants her legacy to be, Marta responded: ""I want them to think of me as an athlete that inspired other people, that improved our sport from what it was from the past to what it is now. Not just in Brazil, I mean this for the entire world, because we have the power of changing that.""

""I don't want them to see me just as Marta, the soccer player, the one that scored most goals in the World Cups, the one that won the best player in the world many times; I want them to see me as an athlete that made improvements in our sport."""/['Jeff York']/2020-06-24 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200624081404-marta-tease-super-tease.jpg"
"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/21/football/brazil-1970-world-cup-winning-team-anniversary-pele-dida-spt-intl/index.html"/50 years on, 1970 World Cup-winning team remains Brazil's greatest ever/"(CNN) Every so often, a national team comes along that embeds itself in a nation's psyche.

It can flood a country with hope. It can cause its inhabitants to temporarily forget about their day-to-day woes. Stories of famous victories are passed down through generations.

For nations less blessed with football talent and pedigree, these teams come along perhaps once in a generation. For others, such as five-time World Cup winner Brazil, they come along a little more regularly.

But despite the numerous great teams to have pulled on the famous yellow shirt, there is one in particular that still shines brightest.

The all-conquering side at Mexico 1970 featured Pele, Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostão, Rivellino and Carlos Alberto, Brazil's 'Eternal Captain' and scorer of arguably the greatest goal in World Cup finals history.

It was the last goal scored at that World Cup -- the fourth in a 4-1 hammering of Italy in the final -- and one that epitomized the Joga Bonito (Play Beautifully) mantra that Brazil had long been synonymous with.

Nine of the 10 outfield players had some role in the goal's creation, ending with Pele's pass into the path of the onrushing Alberto, who thumped the ball into the bottom corner.

Captain Carlos Alberto holds aloft the Jules Rimet Cup after Brazil defeated Italy 4-1 in the 1970 World Cup final.

Dazzling Brazil

""We won the World Cup and I think in my life in sport, (that was the pinnacle), no doubt,"" Pele told CNN Sport's Don Riddell of that team in a 2016 interview.

""I said: 'Santos are champion, I am going to retire,'"" Pele recalls thinking before Mexico 1970. ""Then I said: 'No, I am going to play the World Cup. This will be my last World Cup, may God give me one more time the gift to play good.'""

It would be fair to say his prayers were answered.

Sunday marks the 50th anniversary of the 1970 World Cup final and looking back at that tournament perhaps there is a sense of nostalgia, too. That World Cup was the first to be broadcast around the globe in color, making those bright yellow shirts all the more dazzling.

It was perhaps also a victory for those we would today refer to as 'football purists'; Brazil's Jogo Bonito against Italy's catenaccio, the highly-organized and defensive-minded system that defined Italian football for decades.

""When I was little, my father certainly would talk about that extraordinary team,"" former goalkeeper Dida, himself a World Cup winner in 2002, recently told CNN Sport's Don Riddell.

""A team never seen before, a team that would win easily because those were the best of all players -- and among them there was one who made all the difference in the world, Pele.

Brazilian forward Jairzinho is held aloft after Brazil's victory.

""He's number one in the world in my opinion, the strongest player we've ever had. He has proven it, scored more than 1000 goals. The 1970 team is the strongest Brazil has ever had.""

Dida was born three years after that World Cup win in 1970 but the stories he was told by his father made those players his heroes, too.

Long before YouTube and streaming services made even the most obscure reserve leagues available around the world, the 1970 World Cup was the first opportunity many had to watch these superstars in action.

None of Brazil's squad played club football outside of their country, so the world watched on in awe as these unfamiliar faces tore their opponents apart.

At the heart of it all, of course, was Pele.

The Santos forward operated from slightly deeper in a four-man front line, as head coach Mário Zagallo attempted to accommodate Brazil's plethora of attacking talent.

Pele scored two goals and assisted another in the final against Italy.

""When I was in the under 20's, I nearly met him [Pele] but it didn't happen so I became disillusioned,"" Dida recalls of his desperation to meet his hero. ""But then I finally had the opportunity and it was a real great emotion to hug him, feel him, talk to him.

""It's an extraordinary feeling to see an idol so close. This was a great opportunity in my life.""

'Another level'

Dida was part of Brazil's World Cup-winning squad in 2002, another team considered by many to be among the greatest to ever grace the world stage.

The attacking trio of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho is one of the most feared in history, but for Dida it would still be no match for the team of 1970.

""They were above all, another level,"" he says. ""I know football has changed but they would certainly win with the same conditions today and Pele would score.

""It surely ranks in first place [in Brazil's greatest teams]. They would do things with ease and calm. It wasn't that the adversaries were weak, but the talent that team had to improvise was impressive.""

There have been great Brazil teams since. The South American nation has won another two World Cups, no less, but for many Brazilians that side of 1970 continues to hold a place in the heart higher than the rest.

Pelé dribbles past Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich, who later eulogized about the Brazil star.

It was one of those one-in-a-generation teams -- even for a country as blessed with football talent as Brazil -- that had even the opposition eulogizing.

""I told myself before the game, he's made of skin and bones just like everyone else,"" Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich said of Pele after the final.

"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/18/football/paulo-dybala-coronavirus-juventus-serie-a-spt-intl/index.html"/"Paulo Dybala: The boy from the town ""where dreams seem unreachable"" who became a global superstar"/"(CNN) Laguna Larga is an unassuming Argentine town of no more than 6,000 inhabitants.

Down a long stretch of highway sits the nearest large city, Cordoba, and Paulo Dybala's father, Adolfo, would drive the promising young footballer on the 140 kilometer round trip so he could train at the academy of the region's professional team, Instituto.

Few countries in the world have a passion for football quite like Argentina -- Dybala jokes that ""when you are born, first they give you a ball, and then a dummy"" -- and like almost every other child in the country, he dreamed of becoming a footballer.

After Adolfo, it was Instituto that first noticed Dybala's prodigious talent and offered the lithe teenager a place in the club's youth system.

Cordoba in itself can often seem a world away from Laguna Larga, so for Dybala to have made it to Juventus and the Argentine national team -- and played alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the two greatest players of his generation -- is, in his words, ""unthinkable.""

""The truth is, I never imagined I'd reach such heights,"" Dybala tells CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of Serie A's restart on June 20, with Juventus' first game away at Bologna on June 22.

Paulo Dybala made his professional debut for Argentine club Instituto.

""I always wanted to be a football player, I always loved this sport a lot and the truth is -- and I'm sincere -- I never thought that I would get here, to a club as important as Juventus, to play for the national team of my country, to play with the best players in the history of football.

""I really enjoy what I'm experiencing every day, because it's something that is unthinkable for a person who comes from such a small town, where we are six thousand inhabitants, where dreams often seem unreachable.

""Today I am fulfilling almost all of them and surely with time goals are going to continue to arise, dreams, that I hope I can continue to fulfill, but I try to enjoy it as much as for my father as for me, as for all my family too.""

Adolfo was as much a friend to Dybala as he was a father.

In 2008, when Dybala was just 14 years old, the whole family had to try and come to terms with Adolfo's sudden death following a short battle with cancer. Unsurprisingly, the loss of his confidant and biggest supporter affected Dybala's development as both a player and a person.

While his own mental fortitude eventually allowed him to flourish, Dybala credits the support of his close-knit family for getting him through one of the toughest periods of his life.

Paulo Dybala playing for Instituto against River Plate in 2012.

""I can't say what would have happened if he was still here,"" he says. ""Maybe all this would have still happened, maybe not, maybe I would have lived it differently. One never knows why [these things happen], but these are moments in life in which one grows or not -- or many times suffers.

""In my life, luckily, I was able to move forward -- although it was not easy to continue fighting for what I liked [football] -- more than anything to continue doing what made me happy, which is playing football, which is being with a ball, to share time with teammates, friends. That's what football gives me.

""It was a blow, a hard blow for the family, but from then on we started making decisions. I had to start maturing in a certain way a little faster because of the situation I was living and obviously I would have liked to share everything I've lived, everything I have learned and the places I have been, people that I have met with my father.

""But I know somehow he's always with me always. I always feel that when I play, when I am on a pitch, he is close to me and that is what makes me enjoy this beautiful sport even more.""

'La Joya'

Though Dybala still keenly felt his father's absence, he would quickly establish himself as the most promising youngster in Instituto's academy.

At the age of just 17, he made his professional debut for the club in Argentina's unforgiving second division. Such was his immediate impact, an Argentine journalist labeled him 'La Joya' -- The Jewel -- a nickname that still remains.

In only his second match, he broke the 41-year-old record of legendary Argentina striker and World Cup winner Mario Kempes to become Instituto's youngest ever goalscorer.

A babyfaced Paulo Dybala celebrates after scoring for Palermo in Serie A in 2012.

After just one season, he made the leap to Europe with Italian club Palermo in a deal reportedly worth $14 million. Three successful seasons in Sicily followed -- the third of which was truly his breakout in Europe -- and convinced Juventus to part with upwards of $40 million for Dybala's signature.

The last two years have seen the 26-year-old develop from a promising youngster into one of Europe's most exciting talents, with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain both trying to lure him away from Turin last summer.

His recent ascent should perhaps come as no surprise; Dybala, after all, is one of very few players to have had the joy of playing alongside both Ronaldo and Messi.

Dybala says he has a learned a lot from Ronaldo since the Portuguese star moved to Juventus in 2018, noticing in particular an improvement in his mentality.

""The truth is that you learn a lot because he is a player, in this case, who is a winner and that makes you a winner,"" Dybala says. ""He is a very professional player, needless to say. Everyone knows that already.

""How he has managed to make his career, how he has managed to win his trophies, his accolades, everything he has earned through sacrifice, training. So one always feels admiration and tries to learn from the things he has.

Paulo Dybala says he has learned a lot since Ronaldo moved to Juventus.

""I always say that each player has better things than others, so one always tries to pinch off the best that each one has, to learn and grow and from Cristiano there is a lot to learn.""

Since making his Argentina debut in 2015 -- widely thought to be a somewhat belated call-up -- Dybala has shared the international stage with compatriot Lionel Messi.

Dybala is arguably better placed than anyone to answer the eternal debate: Messi or Juventus teammate Ronaldo?

When asked, Dybala smiles and answers diplomatically.

""I see a big difference, but I try not to compare them,"" Dybala says. ""I think I rather try to enjoy them and I just learn from both of them. They are incredible players, the best in history, that everyone will remember forever and I have the opportunity to speak with both of them, to learn from the two, to share pitch with the two.

""Leo is also an incredible player who plays in such a natural way that many times people think that what he's doing is easy and the truth is that it's impossible how he moves, how jumps past players, how he dribbles past players so easily, the truth is that is incredible.

Paulo Dybala and Lionel Messi have been Argentina teammates since 2015.

""Over time, he has been perfecting that way of playing, of working. He is a very professional player, too, which often does not get talked about it, but in training sessions he is amazing. The truth is, well, working with these two monsters is very nice.""

Overcoming coronavirus

Back in March, when the coronavirus pandemic first began to take an unrelenting grip on Italy and Europe, Dybala was one of the first high-profile sportsmen to test positive for Covid-19.

It was at home one evening when he first noticed something was wrong. Something as simple as climbing the stairs would leave him trembling and short of breath.

Two Juventus teammates, Daniele Rugani and Blaise Matuidi, had already tested positive and Dybala soon had it confirmed that he was the third.

""Luckily I never had very strong symptoms that worried me, so I didn't get scared,"" Dybala says. ""But I always took precautions and I always tried to speak with the doctors to remain calm.

""At first the symptoms were calmer but I noticed certain problems, some difficulty in my breathing at the time of training. The symptoms, in general, I felt at night when I was going to sleep or when I was lying down.

""I always tried to remain calm, to give my family tranquility as well because I didn't want to worry them, since they were far away.""

For almost two months, his fight with the virus was played out in the media amid reports he had tested positive four times, leading many people to assume that he had become reinfected.

Dybala says it was difficult reading certain inaccurate stories on his health, in particular when they would cause his family to frantically phone him from Argentina.

His girlfriend, Argentine actress and singer Oriana Sabatini, also contracted the coronavirus but Dybala says the couple stayed calm, more for their families' sake than their own.

""I just had to try to reassure my family, since they were already far away,"" he says. ""So both me and my girlfriend tried not to worry. We also saw and read things from many people who were worse than us.

""So being quarantined with the coronavirus and being able to stay calm in our home, we always tried to take it very cautiously, very calmly. If we decided to send a message, we did it in a positive way to not alarm people.

""The doctors explained to me that in a minority of cases, the time in which the coronavirus stays in the body is a little longer, depending on the body's defenses in each person, or how fast one can create the antibodies so that the virus goes away.

""Mine took a little longer. Fortunately, my girlfriend's left earlier, so she had fewer tests than me. That's where many times people get confused when they think you can catch it again. What is true is that I never got reinfected, it never left. I always had it.""

Piedmont, the area of Italy where Juventus is based, was one of the regions hardest hit by the pandemic. The club set up the 'Distant but united' campaign to help raise funds for the purchase of medical equipment and support local healthcare facilities and medical staff.

The first-team squad and coach Maurizio Sarri also agreed to give up four months' wages to help the club manage the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, saving the club more than $100 million.

Dybala says the players didn't hesitate when they were asked to take a pay cut. Their only concern was ensuring all of the club's employees continued to receive their salaries throughout the crisis.

Football's return

Juventus' Coppa Italia semifinal against AC Milan on Friday was the first time elite football had been played in the country since authorities postponed the season back in March.

While there has been some talk about letting fans back into stadiums, for now all matches will continue to be played behind closed doors. Wednesday's final, which Juventus lost to Napoli on penalties, saw banners in each of the clubs' colors draped over the seats at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.

It's been called the ""new normal"" by many, but Dybala says it's something he could never get used to. He finds the completely empty stands particularly hard to accept when, in his eyes, much of Italian society has returned to normal.

Paulo Dybala has questioned why some fans aren't allowed back into stadiums.

""It's weird finding yourself playing a game without fans,"" Dybala says. ""But it's also weird that when I go down the street I see bars or restaurants full of people, with people outside, without [distancing] measures -- then it seems strange to me that certain things are enabled and other not.

""Because what is the difference between a disco full of people, to a stadium takes its [distancing] measures so that a certain number of people can go? I know that it's difficult for that to happen, but for many things sometimes people just have to make the decision.

""I spend every day in the city center, going to train or going to certain places, and the truth is that I see many people like that, to some extent they have already forgotten about the coronavirus and it's as though nothing has happened anymore.

""I think that many rules are being violated and the truth is that in football, without people it is sad. Without the public, without our fans, playing football is boring, because I think they are part of the atmosphere of this, which is the most important thing in football.""

Dybala hopes that by the time the Champions League returns -- confirmed by UEFA to be in August -- restrictions on fans will have been eased slightly. After all, Juventus will need all the help it can get to overturn the 1-0 first-leg defeat to Lyon.

However, the club's focus is now on securing a ninth consecutive top-flight title. After months of health problems, Dybala is finally fighting fit and ready to lead Juventus through the remaining 12 league matches -- thanks in part to his new ""training partner,"" puppy Kaia.

Dybala and Sabatini adopted the Shiba Inu at the start of lockdown but after only four days she, too, developed health problems.

""One day she was bitten by a bug in our garden and we had to take her to the vet,"" Dybala recalls. ""For a day she scared us a little because she wasn't very well, she was vomiting.

""Luckily she's fine now and getting huge. She's very big and we're happy to now see her growing,"" he adds with a proud smile, as though talking about a child.

Dybala knows the size of the task that lies ahead; second placed Lazio was the most in-form team in Europe before the coronavirus brought Serie A to a halt and in Ciro Immobile boasts one of this season's most prolific strikers.

For now, though, he's just enjoying being able to play football again.

""It was something I really missed,"" he says. ""I have never been so long away from my colleagues, my work, the people around us. There are many people with us that often are not seen, that are not in front of the cameras, like doctors, physiotherapists, part of the technical staff, press people, kitmen, analysts.

""I forget the amount of people that we have with us and you miss sharing all those things day by day. Obviously now we're enjoying it again, trying to get everything we were doing back into rhythm.

""We want to continue winning trophies. We want to stay on top of Italian football. It won't be easy, but hey, we will give it our best shot."""/['Matias Grez', 'Cnn Video Noura Abou Zeinab']/2020-06-18 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200617101607-01-paulo-dybala-argentina-instituto-2012-file-super-tease.jpg"

"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/11/motorsport/toto-wolff-of-formula-e-spt-intl/index.html"/'Toto Wolff of Formula E' aims to make sparks fly for Mercedes/"(CNN) His boss might be famed Mercedes F1 chief Toto Wolff, but Ian James is bringing his own ""passionate"" approach as head of the marque's fledgling Formula E team.

The Briton has been tasked with turning Mercedes , the dominant force of Formula 1, into the front-runner in the electric racing series.

Its appearance in Formula E is down in no uncertain terms to a dramatic and very public U-turn by Wolff, who was an early skeptic of the series.

He even said at the team's unveiling he ""didn't believe that Formula E could make it.""

Now, though, Wolff is a fully fledged convert, and he turned to James to lead Mercedes' venture into electric motor sport.

James shuns comparisons with Wolff, but also aims to copy his boss.

""It's brilliant to work with someone like Toto,"" said James. ""At a race weekend, we speak on multiple occasions. His focus is Formula 1 but he is still very much involved in the Formula E programme.

""What I try to do is the same as Toto, which is holistic. I'm passionate about racing and making sure we're always moving in the right direction. He does that very well.

""He'll leave us to it but he offers great advice when it comes to drivers or analyzing what went wrong at a race and what could have been done better.""

Wolff v Wolff in Formula E

Ian James and Toto Wolff at the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team launch with the teams' drivers Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne.

Despite Wolff's split interest and direction, James is adamant it will have no bearing on Lewis Hamilton or Mercedes' continued ambition to remain No.1 when the F1 season gets under way in Australia next month.

But the Austrian is not the only Wolff James has to deal with. Toto's wife Susie, team principal of the Venturi team , is a partner in using the Mercedes EQ powertrain but also a grid rival.

James laughs at the idea he might be caught in the midst of a Wolff vs. Wolff on-track battle. ""It's certainly a unique position to be in,"" he said. ""But it's great to have Susie on board as she's someone I can have a very open dialogue with.

""We know if we take the right approach and work collaboratively, we can develop both teams faster together. And it would be a dream if all four drivers are fighting for the top spots. Then it gets serious.""

Like Wolff, James' passion for motor sport growing up lay in F1, first getting hooked at the age of five or six.

For him, the standout early moment was spilling onto the circuit at Silverstone when Nigel Mansell won the 1991 British Grand Prix and famously gave rival Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pit lane after he ran out of fuel at the finish.

After studying mechanical engineering at university, James' first job came at McLaren working on the Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren for three and a half years before a switch to Mercedes where he has worked for the last 15 years.

'We're racers'

His roles have been multifarious: part of the team behind the introduction of KERs in 2011 and helping the returning Mercedes to a first victory the following season with Nico Rosberg. But he was also heavily involved in the powertrain development which led to the first world titles in 2014 and the ongoing dominance.

""I'm a jack of all trades, master of none,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer by trade but genuinely a bad one. I've had time in finance and marketing, in program management. It's been a mixed bag.

""And with this, I was lucky -- it was genuinely too good to turn down, not just getting back into motor sport which is a passion of mine but also the opportunity to start up a business.""

And like any motor sport business, the primary goal is winning.

""Internally, there's enough understanding and empathy that expectations are kept in check in our rookie year in a complex series,"" he said. ""But externally we're the team with the three-pointed star, one linked with great success in F1 and DTM before that.

""It takes time, look at F1 for example. But we want to win the competition as we're racers. The mid-term goal is to get into championship contention but we're aware how challenging that will be.

The Adria Tour, which took place in Zadar last weekend, has been mired in controversy after the final was canceled following Grigor Dimitrov's positive test.

Djokovic, the world No.1 tennis star who was scheduled to play in Sunday's final, confirmed Tuesday that both he and his wife Jelena had also tested positive for Covid-19 upon returning home to Serbia, while his children's results were negative.

The 17-time grand slam champion said he was sorry that the tournament had caused harm and acknowledged ""we were wrong and it was too soon."" He said that the organizers would be sharing health resources with those who attended the events in Belgrade, Serbia, and Zadar, Croatia.

""I am so deeply sorry our tournament has caused harm. Everything the organizers and I did the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions. We believed the tournament met all health protocols and the health of our region seemed in good condition to finally unite people for philanthropic reasons. We were wrong and it was too soon. I can't express enough how sorry I am for this and every case of infection,"" he said in the statement published on his Twitter account.

""If you attended the Adria Tour or were around any attendees please get tested and practice social distancing.

The rest of the tournament has been canceled and we will remain focused on all those who have been affected. I pray for everyone's full recovery.""

Djokovic hits a return during the Adria Tour in Zadar, Croatia.

Earlier, Djokovic defended organizing the four-stage charity event hosted in the Balkans in a statement on his website.

""It was all born with a philanthropic idea, to direct all raised funds towards people in need and it warmed my heart to see how everybody strongly responded to this,"" said the tennis star.

""We organized the tournament at the moment when the virus has weakened, believing that the conditions for hosting the Tour had been met.

""Unfortunately, this virus is still present, and it is a new reality that we are still learning to cope and live with.

""I am hoping things will ease with time so we can all resume lives the way they were. I am extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope that it will not complicate anyone's health situation and that everyone will be fine.""

Djokovic added that he would remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days and have another test in five days' time.

'Boneheaded'

With the ATP Tour suspended until August 14, the Adria Tour started in Serbia earlier this month and both events have taken place with fans in attendance.

The eight players competing in Zadar last weekend were photographed in close physical proximity, posing for photos and playing basketball together. Croatian Borna Coric confirmed he had also tested positive for coronavirus.

Her coach doubts it/"(CNN) Serena Williams' decision of whether or not to play at the US Open -- if it is held -- may come down to family. It's yet another in the many personal crises facing sports stars amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou told CNN that the record 23-time grand slam winner -- and six-time champion in New York -- most likely won't take part in her home major if her nearly three-year-old daughter Olympia isn't with her. Tennis officials are debating limiting player entourages to one accompanying person only, to enable the Grand Slam to safely take place.

""Will she be OK to be three weeks without a daughter? I doubt it,"" Mouratoglou said. ""She's never been one day without her ... but only she can answer this question.""

The USTA is set to decide on the fate of the year's third grand slam this week, possibly on Monday.

Williams' personal decision comes at a time of intensifying debate about how competitions like the US Open can be held.

Last week, divisions between players emerged after the USTA proposed a series of strict restrictions to enable the grand slam to take place.

The governing body proposed creating a bubble for players at an airport hotel outside of Manhattan -- where most players stay -- and restricting entourage numbers to just one.

Strong opposition, then criticism

The plans were met with strong opposition from some leading pros, including reigning Wimbledon champions Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep . Djokovic used the word ""extreme"" and said choosing only one person would be ""impossible.""

Rafael Nadal , meanwhile, told reporters earlier this month it wasn't an ""ideal"" situation. The other member of the men's Big Three, Roger Federer, won't be at the US Open if it is held as he is recovering from a second knee surgery in 2020.

Djokovic, the world No. 1 who is also president of the ATP Player Council, then faced criticism from former Australian Open semifinalist Danielle Collins.

""This is a massive opportunity for players to start making money again, and here we have the top player in the world saying only being able to bring one person will be too difficult because he won't be able to bring his entourage,"" the 51st-ranked American wrote on Instagram.

Mouratoglou accepts the limitations of moving between hotel and the stadium for weeks would be a challenge, but he thinks from a logistical standpoint it could still work.

""I think it's possible to go with just a coach,"" he said. ""I mean 40 years ago it was like that ... so if I speak for myself, I would do the practice sessions. I would have to play with Serena, or she can hit with other players rather than her hitting partner. The fitness I can do, I can have the fitness coach send me the sessions.

""She can use the physios at the facility. So everything is possible.""

With tentative plans set for the Cincinnati Open to take place at Flushing Meadows as a warm-up event before the US Open, the main draw would get underway Aug. 31.

Regardless of the difficulties, the financial impact of the pandemic on tennis players themselves is now becoming so acute, that Mouratoglou -- sharing a similar stance to Collins -- says the US Open must take place.

The players have been off the tour since early March, with Wimbledon in July officially canceled two months ago.

""No discussion,"" he said. ""It needs to take place for financial reasons. It's a big federation with a lot of people working that they need to pay. I know the USTA already had to fire quite a lot of people, and I think they need this money.""

New format launched

It is with this existential backdrop for the sport that this weekend Mouratoglou launched the 'Ultimate Tennis Showdown' -- a round-robin tournament featuring top players from the men's game including ATP Finals winner Stefanos Tsitsipas.

They compete under a completely new format and rules, with matches broadcast live via a streaming platform for a subscription of $11 per month.

It's a reimagining of tennis that Mouratoglou has long thought about. Now with Covid-19 restrictions keeping the traditional tennis season on hold, he has taken his chance.

""If people like it, if people subscribe because they really enjoy watching UTS matches, then we are set to survive in an extremely difficult economic environment,"" the Frenchman said.

""My goal is to bring onboard new fans. And if we bring new fans, it's going to be great for the whole industry. And I'm sure that some of them will discover tennis. And maybe if they start to like this sport and like the players, they will also watch ATP, WTA and grand slams.""

The tournament appeals by both providing live competition under current social distancing rules, and breaking the traditional tennis format. This weekend saw hour-long round-robin matches, in a matchplay format that forced players at times into a confrontational climax. On court-coaching -- which is normally banned - was allowed during frequent 30 second time outs between points.

Penalties were relaxed for emotional displays like racket-smashing and cursing, although the players appeared to enjoy the format enough that such outbursts were limited.

The most experimental additions are the ""UTS cards"" which players can use when they choose during the match to bend the rules and permit them various tactical advantages, like for example not letting your opponent have a second serve.

It's a world away from the codes of conduct of the traditional game and Mouratoglou admits this new approach could take players time to adjust.

""I don't know how much it's going to be natural for them to express more feelings, more emotions. But it's fine if not everyone does it, because we have different personalities,"" he said. ""I don't want to have clones that are all crazy and breaking rackets. That's not the point.

""For a good show, you need different personalities. I think after a few weekends they are going to start to loosen up more with that new format and probably express more and more feelings.""

Serena keen to join

For now, the inaugural round of UTS matches is limited to the men, but a women's tournament is certain to follow with Williams keen to participate.

""When I had the idea and I decided to launch it, I took my phone and I called Serena to talk to her about it and the first thing she said to me was: 'Are the women playing?' And I said for the first one I couldn't do both -- if I added the women to the men I would have no chance to launch,"" said Mouratoglou.

""But actually, she gave me some super ideas to incorporate into the next show, so women are going to come very soon to UTS, that's definitely the goal. And Serena, of course will be part of it."""/['Christina Macfarlane']/2020-06-15 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200614204031-serena-mouratoglou-super-tease.jpg"
"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/23/football/burnley-white-lives-matter-banner-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html"/As Burnley condemns 'White Lives Matter' banner, social media comments suggest some fans still miss the point/"(CNN) English Premier League club Burnley's condemnation of a ""White Lives Matter"" banner that flew over the Etihad Stadium on Monday has drawn angry and confrontational reactions on social media.

Burnley issued a statement during the match against Manchester City saying those responsible for flying the banner would be issued lifetime bans at the club, while captain Ben Mee and coach Sean Dyche also spoke out against it.

However, the club's social media pages were flooded with criticism to the club's response.

""Ben Mee absolute disgraceful comments,"" read one comment on Burnley's Facebook page.

""Both him and the Burnley press officer should be collected their stuff in a cardboard box this morning and kicked out the club.""

Another Facebook comment read: ""So totally wrong Burnley, you will for pay for this. Hope they fly it over all your remaining games,"" while others said: ""racist Scumbags condemning that plane"" and ""you ought to be ashamed of being ashamed you idiots.""

A plane flies over the Etihad Stadium with a banner reading ""White Lives Matter Burnley.""

""We'll not grace the social media comments with a statement,"" a Burnley media spokesman told CNN.

On Tuesday, Burnley issued a detailed statement outlining its policy of making the organization ""one club for all"" and representing ""all parts of our community.""

""The club operates a zero-tolerance stance on discrimination of any form at Turf Moor and is increasingly issuing lifetime bans for supporters that incite racism and hatred,"" said the statement.

""This punishment will also be meted out to those responsible for Monday's regrettable incident.""

Later on Tuesday in an interview with CNN anchor Phil Black, Burnley CEO Neil Hart said the club had work to do around the ""Black Lives Matter"" message.

""There is a lack of education around 'Black Lives Matter',"" said Hart. ""If we could educate some of these individuals and I don't mean to be patronizing -- if we could educate some of our supporters that would massively help us as a football club.""

'I will refuse to support them'

Although a lot of the anger has erupted on Burnley's social media channels because of the banner, it isn't unusual for the club's accounts to be inundated with anti-Black Lives Matter comments and interactions.

Since the club started promoting Black Lives Matter content, many on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have condemned the club's support -- with some fans going as far as saying they would stop supporting Burnley.

Last week, David Walker was particularly angry at the team's decision to have the Black Lives Matter message on the back of the players' shirts.

""Only 1 thing should be on that shirt,"" he said in a Facebook comment. ""That's the Claret's badge and for the first time in my life I will refuse to support them on Monday night,"" added Walker, referring to Burnley's nickname. The team play in a claret and blue uniform.

Not all the comments were negative.

One user said they were ""incredibly grateful for the players' and club's support of common decency,"" while another said they were ""extremely proud of Burnley football club and what it stands for. A community club for all.""

When negative comments started coming last week -- with the Premier League return -- there were voices on Burnley's accounts trying to explain the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement.

""Understand the meaning of the movement ... The reason why this movement exists and HAS TO exist. It is a reaction to the unjust treatment of Black people. Please just understand that. Then we can have a conversation,"" one user wrote.

In his post-match interview with Sky Sports, Mee added that he felt it was a ""small minority of people"" who were not supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Ben Mee chases the ball during Burnley's 5-0 defeat by Manchester City.

Lancashire police announced on Tuesday that an investigation was taking place into the banner to assess whether ""any criminal offences have taken place.""

Clubs across the Premier League have supported the Black Lives Matter movement since the league resumed last week.

All players of the 20 top-flight clubs have worn ""Black Lives Matter"" in place of their names on the back of their shirts, as well as taking a knee before kick-offs.

""We wish to make it clear that those responsible are not welcome at Turf Moor,"" Burnley said in a statement relating to the ""White Lives Matter"" banner.

""This, in no way, represents what Burnley Football Club stands for and we will work fully with the authorities to identify those responsible and issue lifetime bans.

""The club has a proud record of working with all genders, religions and faiths through its award-winning Community scheme, and stands against racism of any kind.

""We are fully behind the Premier League's 'Black Lives Matter' initiative and, in line with all other Premier League games undertaken since Project Restart, our players and football staff willingly took the knee at kickoff at Manchester City.""

Burnley manager Sean Dyche, whose side lost 5-0 in Monday's game, said the banner was ""clearly unacceptable"" and former Burnley captain Frank Sinclair expressed his ""disappointment"" at the banner.

Ronaldo gave his side an early lead after converting from the penalty spot before striker Paulo Dybala doubled Juve's lead before halftime.

The win takes them four points clear at the top of the table with its closest rival Lazio playing one less match. The two teams meet in Turin on July 20.

Juve's win on Monday marked a welcome return of form for a team that's failed to score in normal time in both of its matches since Italian football restarted amid the pandemic.

Juventus was beaten by Napoli on penalties in the Coppa Italia final on Wednesday after a goalless draw. In the semifinal second-leg Juve had drawn 0-0 against AC Milan, qualifying for the final on the away goals rule.

The game between FC Sochi and FC Rostov went ahead despite the latter's squad being hit by six positive coronavirus tests before the match. Those positive tests meant Rostov's entire senior squad had to be quarantined, according to a club statement explaining its 10-1 defeat.

Prior to the match at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi, Rostov was challenging for a UEFA Champions League place, while Sochi was embroiled in a relegation battle.

Rostov asked Sochi to postpone the match but the team refused, and so it was forced to field a team of young players aged 16-19.

The youngsters took an improbable lead in the first minute, when 17-year-old Roman Romanov scored, becoming the youngest scorer in club history. He is also the third-youngest scorer in Russian Premier League history.

Bouncing pole

After going clear in the first round, Maher rode into a packed O2 arena in the second round in the knowledge another error-free ride would hand him victory over Ireland's Darragh Kenny and Balou du Reventon, who had been leading with two time faults over two rounds.

Maher, an Olympic champion at his home London Summer Olympics in 2012, knows all about performing under pressure.

But for a split second, it looked as if Maher had thrown it all away. Approaching the third fence, the big-striding Explosion W touched a pole. It bounced up in the air as the crowd gasped, but didn't fall.

""I took some risk, I didn't go too fast to jump the clear round,"" said Maher, whose win was applauded by American rock star Bruce Springsteen. ""I had some luck over there on the pink one and it stayed up. I knew it would be my day,"" said the 36-year-old Maher, the only rider to produce two clear rounds.

""I just tried to keep my eye on the job, but I know, when he touches a fence like that, normally, he doesn't touch another fence in the course,"" said Maher. ""I had a little luck, that's what sports is all about.""

An emotional Maher also paid tribute to his team.

Maher and Explosion W finished their stellar season on a high in Prague.

""Just amazing feeling, to be able to win here, on this horse, and the people that are around me, to make this possible, they all know who they are. It's an amazing feeling towards the end of the year.""

GCL Super Cup

The four-day Global Champions Playoffs will end on Sunday with the €6.4 million GCL Super Cup for teams.

Last year, Eduardo Alvarez Aznar of Spain teamed up with Holland's Marc Houtzager and Maikel van der Vleuten to take the inaugural GCL Super Cup for the Madrid in Motion team.

Madrid in Motion will join Paris Panthers, Valkenswaard United, Shanghai Swans, Monaco Aces and Cannes Stars in Sunday's final, which will see the winning team ride away with €3 million in prize money.

Friday's semifinals saw the shock elimination of pre-event favorites London Knights, led by Maher, and the St. Tropez Pirates.

The London Knights had finished the regular season at the top of the leaderboard for the second year running, with €2.3 million in prize money. The Pirates, led by last year's LGCT Super Grand Prix champion Edwina Tops-Alexander of Australia, had finished the regular season in second place, with €1.7 million in earnings."/['Danielle Rossingh', 'For Cnn']/2019-11-23 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191124082416-maher-super-tease.jpg"

There was no shortage of star appeal at the weekend with the golf and NFL legends joined by a host of friends, including guest commentator and NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley as well as professional golfer Justin Thomas.

Both chipped in with their own share of trash-talk, creating a competitive edge to the proceedings.

Former world no.1 Thomas proved a hit with his on-course punditry but admitted he was ready to play himself.

""Still trying to get over how fun yesterday was,"" he wrote on Instagram . ""To be involved in something so special was an honor.

""The amount of money raised ($20 million!!!), 4 absolute legends in their games, an amazing venue, an incredible production team who did incredible given the terrible weather conditions.

Four of the greatest athletes the world has ever known, on the golf course at the same time, offering us a glimpse of who they are when they aren't winning Major Championships and Super Bowl trophies.

On Sunday at Medalist Golf Club in Florida, Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning faced off against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady in ""The Match: Champions for Charity."" The goal was to raise more than $10 million for Covid-19 -related causes which provide relief for frontline workers, small businesses, and those in desperate need of food as a result of the pandemic.

Mother Nature didn't play by the rules early on. Torrential rain at the start of the event dampened the excitement and limited the trash talk but, to the players' credit, the weather didn't deter them from the job at hand. Proof that the greatest don't become great without learning how to navigate adversity.

Within the first 30 minutes of the broadcast, more than $1.5 million in additional charitable donations had been raised.

Millions tuned in hoping to get inside the minds of the illustrious foursome. Woods and Mickelson are familiar foes, with Woods besting his compatriot over the majority of their respective careers. Manning went 6-11 against Brady during his time in the NFL.

The quarterbacks were nervous to start and found it difficult on one of the toughest courses in the country.

Woods debuted his signature Sunday red at his home golf course. He came into 'The Match' with hundreds of rounds at the private club under his belt, and his experience showed.

Woods and Manning read a putt on the sixth green during The Match: Champions For Charity at Medalist Golf Club.

Woods' ease was delightfully juxtaposed by the play of the greatest quarterback in the history of American football, Tom Brady, who quickly became the focal point through the first nine holes.

The ultra-exclusive, and incredibly challenging, Medalist made the otherworldly quarterback look refreshingly human, as he struggled to find the fairway. Brady was the butt of the joke (quite literally when his pants split down the back) until the six-time Super Bowl winner holed-out from the fairway on the Par-5 7th hole in the greatest moment of the event.

To be fair, Brady has had less time to practice his swing than Manning, who is good friends with Woods and has played multiple rounds at the venue in the past.

Known for his maniacal preparation, Woods joked earlier in the week that Manning approached the contest like he was playing Brady and the rest of the New England Patriots, relentlessly sending Woods different videos of his game, asking for things to work on, and requesting drills from golf's greatest player to make sure he was ready to go.

The homework seemed to pay off, as Manning was masterful on the par 3's with his irons and stayed consistent for the majority of the day.

For golf enthusiasts craving quality insights, Mickelson committed to narrating the day in detail.

He used the cameras mounted to the players personalized golf carts to his advantage -- providing constant feedback and urging much needed dialogue between the competitors.

Later, Mickelson also proved to be a valuable coach to his teammate, walking him through each putt and trying to keep his confidence up while the NFL star struggled.

As expected, Charles Barkley was an asset to the broadcast, most notably in prompting trash talk between the foursome. His natural curiosity and affable personality brought the best out of the high-profile athletes.

Mickelson and Brady on the 13th green.

""I've learned something through this pandemic, we need sports, man,"" Barkley told CNN last week. ""Are they the most important thing in the world? Not even close. But the one thing they do, they take your mind off of all the other stuff going on in the world.""

The back-nine featured an alternate-shot format and, after a beautiful drive off the tee on the par 4 11th from Mickelson, Brady finished the hole with an eagle putt to get the duo back in the game.

The pair punctuated their celebration with an ""air high-five,"" a brief but stark reminder of why they were there in the first place -- to help those affected most by the coronavirus.

""There are so many people struggling all over the world. I was born in South Africa and I'm always paying attention to the events that are happening around the world, particularly in South Africa where I'm from,"" said 2008 Masters Champion Trevor Immelman, who was Barkley's co-analyst.

""This pandemic has been so brutal for so many people globally. I've always been struck by how Americans are willing to jump behind a charity. They are willing to jump in and raise funds for people that are struggling. It never ceases to amaze me how great Americans are at doing that. At the end of the day, you've got $10 million-plus dollars being raised in a single afternoon.""

As millions of dollars continued to pour in from celebrity donations and corporate contributions, the rain came again midway through the back nine. In an engaging twist, it seemed to add to the drama, with the competitive fire between the four superstars burning brightest in the final few holes.

The intensity picked up on the par-3 16th, with a big putt from Mickelson cutting Woods and Peyton's lead to one. In the end, the event ended as many thought it might -- with the putter in Woods' hand on 18 to seal the win for him and Manning.

Despite less than ideal playing conditions, the broadcast found a way to showcase some great trash talk, highlight a strong competitive undertone, and raise a total of $20 million for charity. All things considered, the event was a rain-soaked success.

""Knowing that $20 million was raised is amazing,"" Manning told TNT after the event. ""It was an honor to be invited to this, and it's something I will always remember and cherish."""/['Carolyn Manno']/2020-05-25 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200525100619-tom-brady-super-tease.jpg"

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) did not immediately respond to CNN but in a statement released to British media the organization said it was determined to ""accelerate change and grow awareness,"" as the Black Lives Matter movement prompts corporations and institutions to rethink how they operate.

In recent weeks following George Floyd's death , a number of British organizations , such as the Bank of England, and businesses have been reviewing their historical associations with slavery.

""The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve diversity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness,"" the governing body said in a statement.

""The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or its sensitivities.

""We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.""

English rugby union fans at the HSBC London Sevens at Twickenham Stadium on June 2, 2018 in London.

Former England rugby union player Maggie Alphonsi spoke out about why she no longer sings the song, writing on Twitter : ""I will NEVER stop using my voice!!""

Brian Moore, a former English rugby union player and commentator said : ""The world has moved on and, rightly, things that were normal then should not necessarily be normal now ... It should be celebrated in its rightful context.""

But former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan posted a news story about the issues around the song on Instagram with the caption: ""Please tell me if I am wrong ... but this surely can't be right !!??""

Is it right for rugby fans to sing a slave-era song?

The song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals. Revered, emotive, and rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.

But for the last three decades, the familiar melody has also been the adopted anthem of England's rugby union team, its haunting chorus a common echo in stadiums where the national team plays.

And therein lies the problem.

Cornell Brooks, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Should lyrics which are about suffering and despair be sung by thousands of England fans who are often middle-class, often White?

""A slap in the face to the history of slavery,"" Cornell William Brooks, then president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the use of this spiritual in a sporting arena. Brooks is now Hauser Professor of the Practice of Nonprofit Organizations and Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership and Social Justice at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism group Kick it Out in 2017, said singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" to cheer a rugby team was a matter of ""ignorance, lack of sensitivity and arrogance,' while American academics have called it cultural appropriation

Three years ago, when asked by CNN whether the RFU would be reviewing the use of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" an spokesperson for English rugby's governing body said: ""Swing Low has been associated with rugby and rugby clubs for decades.

An estimated crowd of 20,000 packed into the Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin Saturday to watch the home side Otago Highlanders host the Waikato Chiefs in the Super Rugby Aotearoa competition.

The lifting of Covid-19 restrictions in New Zealand has allowed fans to return to stadiums as the match between Otago Highlanders and Waikato Chiefs is watched by an estimated crowed of 20,000 at the Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin.

Guard Natasha Cloud and post player LaToya Sanders -- two starters from the WNBA defending champion Washington Mystics -- will sit out. Additionally, post player Jonquel Jones of the Connecticut Sun, who finished third in the WNBA MVP voting last season, announced her decision to not play.

Cloud is choosing not to play to focus on social reform, while Sanders and Jones cited health reasons.

Cloud, Sanders and Jones join Atlanta Dream guard Renee Montgomery -- who said she intends to sit out the season to help continue the fight for social justice reform in the US -- in not playing.

Another Atlanta Dream player, guard Tiffany Hayes , has also said she will skip the season, stating in an Instagram post, ""This was not an easy decision but I believe it is in my best interest with everything that is going on right now. Although I love playing this game, I believe there are much more important things to be thinking about in this moment.""

""There are a lot of factors that led to this decision, but the biggest one is that I am more than an athlete.

So at what point for our White counterparts and our White teammates do you step up to the plate for us? You can go to war for us on the field or on the basketball court, but what are you doing behind the scenes when we go home and we're getting pulled over on our way home?""

""When you're talking about the game of basketball, today, right now, I could care less. Our calling right now is to use our God-given platforms, to use our voices and to collectively come together for something greater than all of ourselves combined.""

"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/06/sport/newcastle-united-takeover-billionaire-investment-european-football/"/How billionaire owners changed European football/"Global Investment How billionaire owners changed European football

(CNN) — European football is no stranger to billionaire owners, and the latest deep-pocketed investor to show interest in acquiring a team stirred the English Premier League as it lay dormant during the coronavirus lockdown.

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is part of a three-party consortium attempting to buy Newcastle United. The other partners are PCP Capital Partners, a venture capital and private equity company run by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, and private equity and real estate firm Reuben Brothers.

For Newcastle fans, the proposed takeover heralds overdue change.

After 13 years under the ownership of Mike Ashley, the British businessman who runs retail brand Sports Direct, the feeling is that the club has been starved of investment for too long.

Newcastle, a powerful force in English football during the 1990s, suffered two relegations under Ashley’s tenure. The decision to temporarily rename the club stadium to The Sports Direct Arena in 2011 was also met with fan resentment.

Hostility to the Ashley regime probably explains why a survey by the Newcastle United Supporters Trust in April found that 96.7% of the more than 3,397 fans questioned were in favor of the new ownership group, which is being fronted by PCP.

The hope is that the new owners can inject more money into the club and propel Newcastle back to the top of English football.

The takeover has been rumbling on for months with other investors reportedly interested in buying the club. Before a takeover goes through, any successful bid must pass English football’s Owners’ and Directors’ test.

“If the fans have faith in the owners then that builds trust and trust builds time,” Kieran Maguire, a university lecturer on football finance and author of The Price of Football, tells CNN Sport.

“If it was me [as a new owner], the focus would be to have a strategy, have a director of football who can therefore say, ‘This is the way that Newcastle United is going to go forwards, this is going to be our style of play in conjunction with the manager.’

“It’s the dull stuff, it’s the back office, the business operations that I would address first. Fans are looking for a marquee signing [but] I would say that just signing for the sake of signing is a way to waste money.”

Chelsea and Manchester City set the trend for courting big-name signings following takeovers by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mansour respectively.

The Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), in particular, was quick to throw money at City. Maguire says the club spent £62 million ($77 million) on transfers in 2008, the summer after Sheikh Mansour took charge, which included breaking the British transfer record in the purchase of Brazilian forward Robinho.

That was about 12 times what the club had spent the previous year, and City’s outgoings on players only grew in the years that followed.

Two seasons later, the likes of David Silva, Yaya Touré, Mario Balotelli and Edin Džeko were all brought in as, according to Maguire, £165 million ($204 million) was splashed on transfers in 2011; the season after that came Sergio Aguero, who helped deliver City its first league title for more than 40 years in dramatic fashion.

“It is known that wealthier clubs are more successful over the long term than their rivals with fewer resources,” Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at data company Gracenote, tells CNN Sport.

“When the current owners took full control in 2008, Manchester City were outside the top 20 richest clubs, and not amongst England's six wealthiest teams.

“The investment made by the owners made Manchester City competitive in the transfer market with the top English clubs, improving the team to the point that they could regularly challenge for trophies.”

In comparison to other English top-flight teams, Mike Ashley’s limited investment in Newcastle has seen the club twice drop into the Championship and seldom finish in the Premier League's top half. Manchester City’s Abu Dhabi owners invested heavily in player signings after taking over the club in 2008. Four Premier League titles have been won since, though the Champions League trophy has proved elusive. The dominant force in French football, PSG has failed to top Ligue 1 only twice since the Qatari owners bought the club. Much like City, PSG's domestic hegemony hasn't translated into European success.

Gleave also notes that City was rated the 68th best team in Europe when ADUG took over according to Gracenote’s Euro Club Index, which ranks all European football clubs based on competition results over a four-year period.

The club has risen up the pecking order under a number of different managers since then, before acquiring the top spot under Pep Guardiola in 2019.

Today, the chances of Newcastle matching the sort of spending that propelled City to success are remote given the restrictions football clubs must adhere to.

In the Premier League, a club can make losses of up to $130 million over three seasons and $33 million over three years for UEFA competitions. On Thursday, UEFA eased its regulations for one year due to Covid-19.

The latter’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations won’t immediately apply to Newcastle, but the club will need to be compliant if it wishes to compete in Europe in the near future as UEFA’s checks date back three years.

“If you take a look at both Manchester City and Chelsea when they were acquired by Sheikh Mansour and Abramovich, the initial transfer policy was scattergun and it was very hit and miss,” says Maguire.

“The advantage that both Chelsea and Manchester City had was that both clubs were operating in the pre-Financial Fair Play environment.

“Although I think Newcastle [might] have opportunity to spend more money than they have historically, they can’t just spend £100 million ($124 million) and write it off as easily as Chelsea and Manchester City were able to do back in the pre-Financial Fair Play days.”

Money spent on stadium infrastructure, a club’s academy, its women’s team, or community projects falls outside spending restrictions. City’s Abu Dhabi owners have been able to invest in a state-of-the-art academy stadium and training facilities around the Etihad Stadium.

“Like any new owners coming in, it'll be important that [Newcastle] have got the right people to give them the right advice to make sure they're spending their money as cleverly as possible … to maximize every pound that they are going to invest in,” sports lawyer Daniel Geey tells CNN Sport.

“Anyone expecting owners to come in even with very deep pockets and to spend like, for example, Roman Abramovich did, or Sheikh Mansour has done with Manchester City – I think those days are a little bit behind the Premier League.”

“In the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. It’s a well-run club financially.” Kieran Maguire

Newcastle may also benefit from Ashley’s frugal ownership if the new consortium purchases the club.

“If he’d been fairly loose with the cash, it could be that the new owners would inherit a club where they could only go and spend an extra £20 million ($24.5 million) next season because the losses from the last couple of years were so high,” explains Maguire.

“But in the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. It’s a well-run club financially. Which means of that £105 million ($130 million) loss, all of that is practically available to the new owners immediately.”

Overspending does have consequences. City has been banned from the Champions League for the next two seasons for contravening FFP rules, although the club has called the charges “entirely false” and is appealing the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport is due to announce its decision on City’s appeal in early July.

Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the president of French side Paris Saint-Germain, which is owned by sovereign wealth fund Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), has also been investigated by UEFA for illegal spending.

PSG has won the Ligue 1 title seven times since QSI took control of the club in 2011.

It smashed the transfer record by signing Neymar Jr. for $263 million from Barcelona in 2017, the same window that Kylian Mbappe also joined from AS Monaco.

An investigation launched in September 2017 to determine whether PSG had contravened FFP regulations was concluded last year when CAS upheld PSG’s appeal against the case.

Notably, for all their domestic success, neither City nor PSG have attained the same heights in Europe.

City lost to English rivals Liverpool and Tottenham in the final eight of the past two seasons, while PSG has fallen in the round of 16 in the past three campaigns, never reaching the semifinals under the Qatari owners.

But there’s little doubt that long term investment in a football club can yield returns, particularly in England’s top-flight league.

City is today part of City Football Group (CFG), a global network of associated clubs which includes teams in the United States, Australia, Japan and Uruguay.

Originally owned solely by ADUG, the China Media Capital consortium bought a 13% stake for $400 million in December 2015, while US private equity giant Silver Lake acquired just over 10% of CFG for $500 million last year.

“The Manchester City model, which is to buy lots of clubs around the world, is proving to be of benefit to them,” says Maguire.

“Very much the case at present is that Manchester City is the mothership and if they identify a good player in Spain or Uruguay or Australia or New York or wherever, that individual could then potentially be acquired by Manchester City at a very reasonable fee at a later point in time.

“It is a good strategy and I think it will reap its rewards in due course.”

Of course, the Abu Dhabi owners are 12 years down the line with City. The Newcastle deal is yet to be processed and has come under intense scrutiny since news of the potential ownership change surfaced.

Human rights group Amnesty argued that Saudi Arabia’s interest in Newcastle serves as “a PR tool to distract from the country's abysmal human rights record,"" while Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of late journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said the takeover would “stain” the Premier League.

Last month, Khashoggi’s children publicly forgave their father's killers, sparing five government agents the death penalty. The CIA concluded in 2018 that bin Salman personally ordered Khashoggi's murder, which the crown prince denies.

Qatari-based media giant beIN Media Group has also voiced concerns about the proposed takeover given Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in illegally streaming football matches.

BeIN CEO Yousef Al-Obaidly wrote to the Premier League, alluding to the ""direct role"" Saudi Arabia has had in the ""launch, promotion and operation"" of alleged pirate streaming service beoutQ.

Earlier this week, the World Trade Organization ruled that Saudi Arabia had acted unlawfully in relation to beoutQ's operation, a decision that was welcomed by UEFA.

Under Premier League rules, owners of clubs can be disqualified if they don’t pass the Owners’ and Directors’ test before acquiring a club.

Both Newcastle and the Premier League declined to comment when contacted by CNN in relation to the takeover.

The PIF and Saudi officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the takeover and criticism from Amnesty and Cengiz, while the Saudi Ministry of Media did not respond to the piracy claims.

Whether the new consortium will successfully purchase Newcastle hangs in the balance.

If the deal goes through, there will be an expectation the Magpies punch above their mid-table performances of recent seasons. But given the competitive nature of the Premier League, success is unlikely to come quickly or easily.

“I think the new owners will be able to bridge that gap [with the league’s top teams], but part of the reason that gap exists is because the other clubs are global brands,” says Maguire.

“It will take time for Newcastle to expand their influence on a more global sphere. But if they can qualify for Europe on a couple of occasions then they will become Saudi Arabia’s local club, as it were.”"/[]//"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/06/sport/newcastle-united-takeover-billionaire-investment-european-football/media/images/card.jpg"
"https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/04/sport/liverpoolpremierleaguetitle/"/​​Liverpool: The agonizing wait for a first Premier League title/"1990 / 91 30 years of dreaming Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football’s biggest prize

Gary Gillespie doesn’t remember how he and his teammates celebrated Liverpool winning the English first division title in 1990. “We probably got together and had a few drinks and reminisced about the season,” the former Liverpool defender tells CNN, chuckling at his hazy recollection.

There was little reason to especially savor that year’s yield, Liverpool’s 18th league title and Gillespie’s third in five seasons, because winning was what the club did. Springtime in Liverpool was the season for picking up trophies.

There was satisfaction and relief, an uplift to the red half of the city after a heartbreaking decade, but not the intoxicating hit on the senses that usually comes with the glory of being the best in the land.

Liverpool, it was assumed, would do it all again in the seasons to follow, or come close at least. No one knew the 1989/90 campaign was an ending, a full stop on what had been an unforgettable sentence in English football history.

“Everybody was used to winning and maybe took it for granted, and, anytime you take anything for granted in life, sometimes it comes back and smacks you in the face,” says Gillespie, “and that’s exactly what happened because we’re talking about this 30 years down the line, and Liverpool haven’t managed to win a title since.”

This year was supposed to be different. Jurgen Klopp’s men were 25 points ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City, within two victories of winning English football’s biggest prize, before the coronavirus pandemic caused the world to pause.

As the 30th anniversary of the club’s last league title success is marked, the wait continues. Agonizing, uncertain, with the story of the club’s revival missing its final page.

‘Managed decline’

1980s Britain. Margaret Thatcher’s decade. The city of Liverpool is fighting for survival.

The docks, once the heartbeat of Liverpool's prosperity, have been in decline since the 1970s. Manufacturing is shrinking, economic stagnation is sharp, the population is in decline, inner-city homes are falling into decay and unemployment is high. The city is also the first in the UK to be hit by the heroin epidemic that will go on to wreck a generation.

“Liverpool was being forced on its knees,” lifelong Liverpool supporter and retired academic Gordon Jenkins, 61, tells CNN. “I remember Chelsea fans used to wave £20 notes at us and say, ‘we’ve got loads of money.’”

On a red-hot July day in 1981, thousands of well-wishers lined London's streets to cheerily wave Union flags in celebration of Charles and Diana's wedding in the English capital. Two-hundred miles away, Liverpool was burning. Appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, had exploded into anger, rapidly descending into nine days of disorder which resulted in hundreds of injuries, arrests and one death.

Widely referred to as the Toxteth Riots, locally it is known as the ‘uprising.’

“This was a city without leadership,” wrote Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister who would go on to construct a framework to revive Liverpool, in his autobiography.

“We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.” Geoffrey Howe, UK finance minister, 1979-83

In the aftermath of the unrest, Thatcher’s closest ministers talked of a “managed decline” of the city, National Archives files would reveal in 2011, with Thatcher's finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, warning: ""We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.""

It was during this decade Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of Britain. Thatcher had polarized and radicalized. A broken working-class city which, historically, had not always leaned to the political left turned red.

But during these divisive times the people had football, two of the country’s outstanding teams in Liverpool and Everton. The beautiful game gave Liverpudlians heroes and hope. Football, says Jenkins, was, and still is, “inexorably woven into the fabric of why we are who we are.”

From 1981 to 1990, the two Merseyside clubs between them won nine league titles, two European Cups, a Cup Winners' Cup, three FA Cups and three League Cups.

Liverpool Football Club had become the bastion of invincibility former manager Bill Shankly had envisaged when rebuilding the club in the 1960s. Shankly’s successors, all appointed from within, had carried the torch. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. Seamless successions upon which a dynasty was built.

“I was there eight years, the worst we ever finished in the league was second,” Gillespie, who left Liverpool for Celtic in 1991, says. “If you finished second it was deemed a failure, you’d had a poor season regardless of what else you’d won.""

The league title was, says Gillespie, the ""be all and end all” and this was especially the case in the latter half of the decade when English clubs were indefinitely banned from European competition following the Heysel disaster in 1985.

“We never got allowed to get carried away,” Gillespie says, identifying the camaraderie formed on boozy nights out as one of the reasons for the club’s success.

“The coaching staff were always calling us ‘big heads’ and any opportunity they had they would try to knock you down. There was never too much praise for us. I don’t think we needed it.

“When we came in after games, we would have to tie our boots so it was easier for the coaching staff to put the boots away. When we took our kit off, we just didn’t throw it on the floor; we had to put the shorts in a pile and the tops in a pile. It was little things like that that kept you grounded.”

A city grieving

Though football saved the city during this decade, it was also the source of unimaginable pain.

On April 15, 1989, Liverpool fans were crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace in Hillsborough, Sheffield, during an FA Cup semifinal. Ninety-six men, women and children unlawfully killed, an inquest would find 28 years later, due to police failings and the criminal gross negligence of the officer in command.

Players had watched the injured and dying being carried away on advertising hoardings used as emergency stretchers and, in the weeks that followed, provided solace for the grieving. At one stage, the 38-year-old Dalglish, by now Liverpool’s player-manager, attended four funerals a day.

Adding to the suffering were the false accusations, published on the front page of the Rupert Murdoch-owned English newspaper ‘The Sun’ immediately after the disaster, that Liverpool fans had urinated on police and pickpocketed dead victims.

“It [the disaster] left its mark on a lot of people,” says Gillespie, conceding that the players still do not like to talk about the tragedy.

At the start of that year, defending league champions Liverpool had been in an unfamiliar position: fifth in the league and nine points behind leaders Arsenal. And, so, the second half of the season was spent in relentless pursuit of the Londoners, with Liverpool eventually bumping Arsenal from the summit with two games remaining thanks to 21 wins in 24 games. Yet the championship was not yet won. The end-of-season title-decider was still to come.

Arsenal’s April visit to Anfield had been rescheduled to the final day of the season because of the Hillsborough disaster, resulting in the jittery Londoners arriving on Merseyside needing to beat their rivals, who six days earlier had won the FA Cup, by two goals to become champions.

No one expected Arsenal to win but this Friday night match under the lights was made legendary as soon as the final whistle blew. In a hallucinatory ending, with seconds remaining and the visitors 1-0 ahead, Arsenal's Michael Thomas burst from midfield and scored, securing an extraordinary 2-0 win -- and the championship -- for the Gunners.

At the final whistle, television cameras capture Dalglish standing silently near the Liverpool dugout, looking into the middle-distance.

“When Arsenal score, you can see a lot of them (Liverpool players) collapse to the floor. They were playing three games a week; they’d been going to all the funerals, and there was a sense that a lot of them were exhausted,” says Gordon.

Business as usual

For those who witnessed it, the 1988/89 season finale lives strong in the memory. But when Liverpool's players returned to pre-season training four weeks later, no one at the club mentioned the Arsenal defeat, or even the previous campaign.

“The coaching staff, the manager, the whole ethos of the club was to never look back, to never linger, regardless of whether you had won the title or lost it. It was just something that was ingrained in us,” Gillespie explains.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade ... it was a remarkable achievement.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

Liverpool’s only major signing that summer was Swedish defender Glenn Hysen, bought from Fiorentina for £600,000 ($670,472).

The new season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 9-0 thumping of Crystal Palace, but this was not a particularly dazzling Liverpool vintage. A 4-1 loss to Southampton led to an indifferent patch and, while Liverpool ended the year topping the table, by March Aston Villa had the initiative.

Meet the 1989/90 squad

Yet Villa stuttered. A home loss to Manchester City was followed by a 3-3 draw with Norwich City and, as any seasoned predator would, Liverpool capitalized. On April 28, 1990, having that day beaten QPR 2-1 at Anfield, Liverpool regained the title.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade … it was a remarkable achievement,” says Gordon.

“We’d been so successful for so long, to say we took it for granted wasn’t quite the case because it was always a great privilege to be a Liverpool supporter, [but] it was like normal service being resumed.”

Relief for a job well done

The smartphone, let alone a wireless network, was still some years from being part of everyday life, so it was left to Anfield’s stadium announcer to inform fans that Liverpool had won a sixth championship in 10 years.

Attending his first Anfield match that day was a seven-year-old John Gibbons. As Liverpool's players walked around the pitch to acknowledge the fans -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the club's idiosyncratic goalkeeper, performing handstands -- Gibbons remembers standing on a seat and serenading the champions to 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'

“It was all fairly understated,” Gibbons, a contributor to the Anfield Wrap podcast, tells CNN. “It was exciting, it was good, but if you’d told anyone in that ground that it would be 30 years until they’d win the next one, they wouldn’t have believed you.”

For the players, soaking up the pressures of expectation was over until the next season at least. “You put 10 months on hold, you give your all for 10 months,” says Gillespie. “Fortunately for us we were normally successful, but I don’t think you can enjoy it [a season].”

English football goes global

But at the beginning of the hedonistic 1990s, Liverpool would learn that even great clubs cannot pause to catch a breath. As Shankly once said: ""Football is relentless ... it goes on and on like a river.""

On the morning of February 22, 1991, with three months remaining of the 1990/91 season, photographers, TV crews and journalists had assembled at Anfield.

The city’s newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, had already prepared its front page because it knew what was to come: Dalglish, with Liverpool three points clear at the top of the table, was going to resign as Liverpool manager.

“Kenny Dalglish as a person has pushed himself to the limit,” said the Scot during the news conference, flashbulbs lighting up his face.

As a Liverpool player, Dalglish had won three European Cups, five league titles and four League Cups and added three more league titles and two FA Cups, including a league and cup double, as player-manager.

But this was a man who had taken on the city’s grief.

In a recent documentary about the man regarded as Liverpool’s greatest player, his family talked of the impact Hillsborough had on him: sleepless nights, mood swings, a rash covering his body, the struggle to make simple decisions.

He had also taken charge of the team shortly after 39 Juventus fans had died before the Italian club’s European Cup final against Liverpool in the Belgian city of Brussels. Supporters, the youngest just 11 years old, killed in a stampede before kick-off in the dilapidated Heysel stadium. It had all taken its toll.

“It all started going wrong when Kenny left,” says Gillespie.

The cracks, which arguably had first appeared when the team suffered an FA Cup semifinal loss to Crystal Palace in 1990, deepened. Celebrated players came to the end of their careers and new manager Graeme Souness made unsuitable, expensive signings.

Thirty miles away great rivals Manchester United were readying to dominate English football’s new age. The birth of the Premier League in 1992 led to a boom: wealth, glitz and the globalization of the English game. Successful on the pitch, United flourished commercially.

This is Anfield: The history of an iconic stadium Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally home to Liverpool’s city rivals Everton, who moved out in 1891. A year later, newly-formed Liverpool started to play there. The stadium, which has four stands, has become one of football’s most iconic venues. In 1906, the famous Spion Kop was constructed. It was converted into an all-seater stand in 1994. Around the stadium there are nods to the club’s past, such as The Shankly Gates, The Paisley Gateway and The Hillsborough Memorial. The Main Stand, built in the 19th century, has been redeveloped in the last decade, boosting Anfield’s capacity to 54,074.







In an interview with English newspaper The Guardian in 2002, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who would guide the Old Trafford club to 13 league titles, uttered a now famous sentence.

His greatest challenge, he said, was “knocking Liverpool right off their f***ing perch.”

With 20 league titles to Liverpool’s 18, the Manchester club can still crow, but United are not the dominant force they once were.

Back on their perch?

Some fans have been known to request selfies on the Kop with Chris Bolland, once they learn how long the 63-year-old has been attending matches at Anfield. A familiar face in the stands since 1966, he remembers plenty of title wins. But neither of his two sons have experienced the joy of watching the team lift a championship trophy.

The family has experienced close calls over the last three decades – second-place finishes under Rafael Benitez and Brendan Rodgers, and last season's astonishing 97-point haul which was eclipsed only by Manchester City -- but during those seasons Liverpool weren't unquestionably the best. Fans dreamed, but never fully believed.

This season, however, Klopp’s men have dropped just five points. Never has a team negotiated a season in England’s top flight in such a relentless, uncompromising manner.

Postponed indefinitely because of the pandemic, no one knows with certainty when or how English football will resume. If the Premier League season were unable to be completed, would Liverpool be denied the championship? For now, that is the unanswered question.

The nervousness which rumbled around Anfield at times last season as the team vied with Manchester City in one of the closest title races in recent memory – though they lost only once, Liverpool missed out on the title by a point – had vanished this season.

Winning the European Cup in Madrid last June, Klopp’s first major trophy as Liverpool manager, had strengthened the fans' faith in the players. They believed. But anxiety increases in uncertain times.

Joy Bratherton, 64, moved to Liverpool in 1974 to be nearer Anfield. Once just one of the few female faces among a crowd of thousands on the Kop, she was enduring sleepless nights even before a global pandemic stopped Liverpool's charge to the league title.

Whether Liverpool will win the Premier League is, she says, ""the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the nighttime.""

""I am having very mixed dreams when I doze off,"" she adds, speaking to CNN days before the UK was put into lockdown. ""The strain and stress of the last two seasons has been overpowering.""

It was after comfortably beating Manchester United in January that the first chants of “we’re going to win the league” echoed around Anfield. A new banner also popped up in the stands at the beginning of the year with the sentence, “This Bird Is Getting Back On Its Perch.”

But the deaths and suffering caused by coronavirus have changed perspectives. Dreams of winning a first league title in 30 years are no longer all-consuming.

“You’ll Never Walk Alone is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

""Not being able to be crowned champions for the foreseeable future is completely irrelevant. It absolutely doesn’t matter,"" says Jenkins.

""Jurgen Klopp, who is Bill Shankly reincarnated, has said football is the most important of the least important things and that just nails it completely. 'You’ll Never Walk Alone' is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent. It’s not just about Liverpool people, it’s about people generally.

""If we didn’t win the league because it was voided, that would be unfair but not a disaster. The real wait is for when we can all go to the match again. That wait is more painful than whether we win the league or not."""/[]//"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/04/sport/liverpoolpremierleaguetitle/media/images/card.jpg"
"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/01/sport/russian-climbers-peak-lenin-spt-intl/"/Peak Lenin: Climbing disaster showcased bravery and pioneering spirit of Soviet women climbers./"Frozen in Time Forty five years ago, eight Soviet women climbers were pinned on top of a high mountain in the USSR in the worst storm in 25 years.

It was June 1974. The Cold War was verging on détente, though the Watergate scandal overshadowed the Moscow Summit between President Richard Nixon and his Soviet Union counterpart, Leonid Brezhnev.

A month later, thousands of miles away in Central Asia, close to the Himalayas in the shadow of Peak Lenin, another meeting took place between an American and a Russian.

Soviet Union Iran India China Soviet Union Iran Saudi Arabia India China Mongolia The map reflects modern-day geography; the Soviet Union border is based on the borders of the countries that were part of the USSR. Map credits: maps4news.com/©OSM, Encyclopedia Britannica In 1974, 170 climbers from a number of countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp in the southern part of the Soviet Union, on the border of what is now Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. They camped in the Pamir Mountains, or Pamirs, a range with some of the world's highest mountains. Many would climb or attempt the 7,134 meter (23,406ft) Peak Lenin. While not considered steep or technical, it is high and subject to severe weather.







Molly Higgins first saw Elvira Shatayeva as she came around a bend in the High Pamirs mountain range, sometimes known as “the roof of the world.”

An Outward Bound instructor traveling the Colorado Rockies, living out of a faded white sedan, Higgins had been asked to a month-long international mountaineering gathering hosted by the Russians.

Nineteen Americans, including two women, attended as part of the 1974 American Pamirs / USSR Expedition. Higgins, then 24, was a last-minute invitee when organizers, many unsure or uneasy about quite where women fit in on expeditions, realized that one woman did not seem like enough.

""I was ambitious and very self-confident, and I thought I was very strong,” recalls Higgins, now a clinical laboratory scientist in Whitefish, Montana.

She was with a crew carrying loads up to Camp II -- Crevasse Camp -- toward Krylenko Pass on the shoulder of Peak Lenin, the country’s second-highest mountain, when an earthquake shook the slopes.

Higgins remembers a creaking sound. Then an avalanche roared overhead, launching off the top of an ice tower above camp.

The avalanche darkened the air, scattered gear, and partially buried one person, with at least two others jumping into the crevasse to escape. Four among the crew had descended earlier to resupply, and for hours those in both groups dreaded that the others had died.

Yet all had survived, though in the lower group Allen Steck, a pioneering climber from Berkeley, California, was buried up to his neck. The two groups joyfully reunited at Camp 1, on the Krylenko moraine, and retreated, shaken, to base camp in an alpine meadow.

Some 170 climbers from 10 Western countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp, with another 60 Eastern European and Russian climbers and officials across a stream.

This was the first major American expedition allowed in the Soviet Union, which has some of the highest and most remote mountains in the world. The gathering was held to showcase the region and the skills of the host climbers and, it seemed, develop relationships with Cold War rivals. It was seen as a means to bring up young mountaineers and foster mountaineering relations between countries.

Meet the climbers

No one could ever have imagined how many things would go wrong that summer, events rained down by the skies and upthrust by the earth, nor the heroics that would ensue.

Yet the story of one of the greatest disasters in all of mountaineering has been almost completely lost.

Even many non-climbers know of Everest disasters and who Alex Honnold is. Yet almost no one today, climbers included, has ever heard about what befell eight Russian women in 1974. A Google search turns up nothing about the 45th anniversary last year.

“He is injured!”

Describing the retreat after the calamitous avalanche, Higgins says: “We came down through these huge boulders, around a corner, and there, standing up, was this absolutely gorgeous, bright-blue-eyed, muscular, bossy hottie on a boulder, and she’s got about four Russian guys around her, and she’s ordering them around.” The woman was in her mid-30s.

Spotting that an American, Mike Yokell, was limping -- after jumping into the crevasse beside Camp II to escape the avalanche -- Shatayeva called out, “He is injured! Take his pack!”

Shatayeva then wheeled around, looked at Higgins, and said in deep, careful tones, “I am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?”

“I am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?”

Master of Sport was the top credential in any sport in the status-aware Soviet Union, even more impressive when attained by a woman.

Higgins recalls: “I thought it was great. I didn’t want to be bossy like that, but here was a woman who really was capable. I wanted to be like her, that strong and that experienced. She was a heroine, right there.”

In an era of relatively few women climbers, Higgins had never met one who was the kind of climber and mountaineer she wanted to be. It was to be the young American’s only interaction with Elvira.

“I knew right then that it was a transforming moment.”

Awkward dynamic

Arlene Blum, a biophysical chemist and environmentalist from Berkeley, California, had applied to the American Alpine Club to join the American contingent, but was declined.

However, some Swiss climbers, through an international women’s climbing club, brought her in on their invitation to be part of a women’s team. The situation created an awkward dynamic when Blum, 29, arrived in the Pamirs and entered the jam-packed mess tent.

As she told the story in her memoir “Breaking Trail,” she approached the crowded American table, but was ignored.

She wrote, “I stood amid the roar of voices, holding my bread and caviar and wishing I could disappear. Blessedly, a striking blonde Russian woman waved me over to her table.”

Shatayeva introduced herself and welcomed Blum. As they talked, she told Blum that most Soviet men thought a women’s team would never succeed on the 23,406-foot Peak Lenin — her group’s aim.

“We plan to be the first women’s team to do it,” said Shatayeva. “Or maybe your group will be.”

Blum, put at ease, said, “Maybe we could all climb together.”

“That is impossible” was the swift reply. Blum could only surmise that the Soviets wanted the first women’s team to be their own. Shatayeva told Blum the larger plan: that the eight women would climb the peak by the Lipkin Ridge on the northeast side and descend the northwest ridge toward the smaller Razdelny Peak. Theirs would be the first traverse, by men or women, of the peak. They were to bivouac, or make a temporary camp, on top.

“Soviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.” Elvira Shatayeva, July 15, 1974.

“We will succeed,” she told Blum. “Soviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.”

Blum today recalls Shatayeva’s “warmth and energy.”

“We shared a common goal of giving women the chance to climb high mountains and were so happy to be in this camp with other climbers who shared our delight in the mountains,” Blum reminisces.

She remembers feeling some concern about the ambitious plan to traverse Peak Lenin.

“This was in the days of the Cold War, when we were in competition with the Russians. I looked at their inadequate tents with button closures and [their] old-fashioned boots and thought how the Russian technology seemed to be going more into space than the mountains.”

“Cat-like blue eyes”

Christopher Wren, a climber and Moscow correspondent for the New York Times (he was to become bureau chief in December of that year), met Shatayeva in base camp early in the meet, which commenced in mid-July.

A passage (later anthologized) from his book “The End of the Line,” about his years in Russia and China, read: “A striking blonde with high cheekbones and cat-like blue eyes, she had come there to lead a team of the Soviet Union’s best women climbers in an assault on Lenin Peak.” Chatting with her over tea, he sensed a “steel core” beneath the surface.

The next time Wren saw Shatayeva was as he and two friends approached the top of Peak Lenin after a storm-blasted, two-night bivouac 1,000 feet below the summit, and spotted a splash of color, a blue jacket in a snow hollow.

“Someone,” he would write of that confused first impression, “seemed to be lying asleep in the bright sunshine.” He thought, An odd time for a nap.

Disciplined unit

Robert “Bob” Craig (who died in 2015, at 90), deputy leader for the American team and author of the subsequent expedition book, “Storm and Sorrow,” wrote: “For the most part, the women remained across the creek in the ‘Soviet Nationalities’ camp. They made several practice climbs, and we observed them a couple of times doing calisthenics in front of their tents.”

The women, whom he described as aged 22 to 35, appeared to be “very serious … still they sang songs together, and not infrequently we would hear their excited chattering and their laughter tinkling like bells across the valley.”

Elvira’s husband, Vladimir Shatayev, later wrote in his memoir, “Degrees of Difficulty,” that the women operated as a disciplined yet congenial unit. “Not once did we hear words of argument or contention.”

She told him, “You should read the minutes” of their meetings. “You men have never dreamed of such openness.”

Shatayeva had already organized the first all-women’s ascent of a 7,000-meter peak — Peak Korzhenevskaya (7,105 meters) -- in Tajikistan in 1972, and led a traverse of the double-summitted Ushba (4,710 meters) in Georgia the following year.

Two nights before the women set out, the American climbers Jed Williamson and Peter Lev strolled over to their camp to say hello and good luck. In a country of regulations, as Williamson, now a retired college president living in Hanover, New Hampshire, says, “It was the first time they were allowed to go without the company of men.” Four of the women had climbed Peak Lenin with males.

Dire natural circumstances

But no one could control weather or geology. The whole Pamirs meet was plagued by snow, rapidly developing avalanche hazard, an earthquake that shook avalanches down (with two more quakes later), and the worst storm seen in the region in 25 years.

At 1:00 a.m. on July 26, barely more than a day after Higgins and her group returned from Krylenko Pass, four climbers forging a new route on the north face of Peak of the 19th Party Congress (or Peak 19) were hit by an avalanche as they slept. Craig, the deputy leader for the American team, and his tent mate, Jon Gary Ullin, were buried. Ullin, 31, an affable and humorous airline pilot from Seattle, was crushed.

Their friends John Roskelley and John Marts had excavated both and tried to resuscitate Ullin when yet another avalanche hit, enveloping Craig again and sweeping away the tents and equipment.

Roskelley, Marts and Craig were then stranded in a snow cave for two days and dropped supplies in a superb collaborative helicopter rescue effort by the Soviets, who allowed Lev a key role as “drop person,” in which he had experience.

Lev, an avalanche forecaster and heli-ski guide, recalls the Russian helicopter being extremely powerful. “I was in the large open door, just hanging onto something,” he says, “and was able to get the drop ‘on their doorstep’” from about 50 or 75 feet above.

“The pilot deserves real credit.”

Five climbers who were not part of the meet and known to visitors only as “the Estonians” went missing on the East Face of Peak Lenin. Three were found to have died in an avalanche, and the other two were rescued and survived. Many accounts incorrectly say all five died.

For most in the assemblage, objectives changed in accordance with the conditions; although Roskelley and Jeff Lowe returned and completed the line up Peak 19, other climbers converged on the “standard” routes.

Meanwhile Higgins, while feeling lonely and isolated among the mostly male contingent, ended up in a group of four (herself; the expedition leader, Pete Schoening; Chris Kopczynski; and Frank Sarnquist) that climbed Peak Lenin via the Razdelny ridge on August 3.

The other American woman on the meet, the much-respected Marty Hoey -- who tragically died on Everest eight years later – also climbed the Razdelny side, with Lev, Bruce Carson and John Evans on August 4. Williamson started with them but, feeling ill, turned back.

While the mountain is not considered steep or technical, it is big and high and beset by challenging weather conditions, with sections of moderately steep ice, especially high on the Lipkin side.

Elvira Shatayeva and the Russian women made final preparations for Peak Lenin climb. July 30 - The Russian women’s team left Base Camp for Camp I. July 31 - The team took the Lipkin route and proceeded toward the summit without any problems. On August 3, Shatayeva called a rest day. August 3 – An American team of climbers behind the Russian women reported: “Cloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions.” August 4 - A major storm was forecast, and organizers recommended all climbers descend. The Russian women were seen walking in a line perhaps 400 feet below the summit. August 5 - The Russian women’s team radioed from the summit. August 6 - The women tried to descend but only managed a few hundred feet. Speaking to base then and August 7, they reported their struggles. Their final transmission came through at 20:30. August 8 - The storm was over. From their final camp, located about 400 meters below the summit, the American team set out for the summit with no idea of the events that had occurred above.

“Our summit day was so hard I couldn’t believe it,” Higgins says. “The altitude … I did some collapsing. It was a really humbling experience. I was very proud of it and so glad it was done.”

Jeff Lowe, a standout young climber (who died of natural causes in 2018), would much later post in an online thread: “[S]ome of the guys on the trip gave her a hard time, claiming she didn't have enough [expedition or alpine] experience to be there. Molly proved them wrong, though -- pulling her own weight and generally comporting herself in a competent manner.”

On August 3, Steck moved up on the Lipkin side with Wren and Jock Glidden. Steck wrote in his diary, as reported in his 2017 memoir, “A Mountaineer’s Life”: “Cloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions. Our altimeter tells us we are at about 5,800 meters,” or 19,030 feet. On August 4, the three took a layover day.

The Americans’ radios had been impounded in customs, so Steck’s group had only a weak radio on loan from the Soviets, and all countries had been put on different frequencies. That day, a major storm was forecast, and Vitaly Abalakov -- Master of Sport for mountaineering in the whole country (who died in 1986) -- recommended that all climbers descend to base. Steck’s group never received the message, nor did Richard Alan North of Scotland.

“Our summit day was so hard I couldn’t believe it.” Molly Higgins, May 5, 2019.

From July 31 to August 3, North, a biomedical scientist now retired and living in Niwot, Colorado, and teammates moved up a “new though not particularly difficult” route to join the Lipkin route.

On August 4, by then climbing alone, North cut steps, as was commonly done in the era, in the steepening ice -- tedious, tiring work accompanied by altitude-induced hallucinations. He reached the top and then descended, slipping a few times and gripping his ice axe for self-arrest on the hard snow. At the foot of the steep section, perhaps 400 feet below the summit, he met the Russian women, walking in a line.

It was windy, with visibility “just a few meters,” he says.

They exchanged greetings, and North was later to recreate the scene in Summit magazine, writing: “They are moving slowly up but in high spirits.

“‘You get a bit short of breath up there,’ I remark jokingly. But the humor is lost on them.

“‘Ah! We are strong. We are women,’ they reply.”

North descended, passing some Soviet men who summited behind him and later joined his descent.

He believes the women climbed the steep icy section and camped that night on the eastern edge of the summit ridge, before moving to the summit the next day.

On the morning of August 5, on the somewhat more straightforward Razdelny side, a Soviet climber came to Blum’s tent at Camp III, the top camp, with a message from base saying, “A storm is predicted. Do not try to climb.”

Still, the air remained calm and fairly clear, people had come a long way and were in position, and some chose to try. Blum, Heidi Lüdi and Eva Isenschmid of Switzerland started up, though the latter two carried extra gear and planned on a possible bivouac, so Blum hastened ahead, with a turnaround time in mind and hoping to beat any weather.

Nearing the top when the storm hit shortly before noon, Blum retreated, soon fighting the wind and blizzard. She was fortunately joined by Williamson, who had started up for the summit again, also with a firm turnaround limit and an eye on the weather. He had retreated from very high -- the summit plateau at 22,800 feet.

Williamson broke trail and urged Blum on when she sat, exhausted. On the way down the pair saw Blum’s two teammates and a Bavarian woman friend and entreated them to descend as well; Isenschmid, a 23-year-old photographer and artist whom North calls a “gentle soul,” was to die in the storm the next day despite strenuous rescue efforts from her partners and French, German and American climbers.

Meanwhile, Steck, Wren and Glidden hiked up to just below the major ridge and in wild storm conditions stopped and camped at 22,000 feet, their Camp IV, the final one.

The Soviet women’s team summitted late afternoon on August 5, carrying full loads (climbers not on a traverse can leave some gear below). At 5:00 p.m. they radioed base camp and said that in the deteriorating visibility they were having difficulty making out the descent and had set up their tents to wait for a break.

Accounts of the ensuing events differ, but Vladimir Shatayev in his book notes that base camp agreed, saying to descend immediately if possible or wait the night. Craig’s book reports that Abalakov told them to descend first thing in the morning on the Lipkin, the route they had ascended and knew.

That night Steck’s group wore their boots and all clothing to bed in case their tent shredded. The Americans had nylon tents with zippers and aluminum poles. Holding up the tent poles, though one snapped, they would outlast the storm. The Soviet women had cotton tents with toggle closures and wooden poles, and according to Craig the wind wrecked two tents the first night.

The morning of August 6 brought five inches of snow at base and, higher, a foot of snow and winds of 70 to 80 mph. Climbers gathered to hear radio transmissions by translator as Shatayeva radioed reports of the sustained whiteout and worsening wind.

At what Vladimir Shatayev states as 5:00 p.m. (though Craig indicates as some hours earlier), Shatayeva reported that one woman had become ill and another seemed unwell. Abalakov told them to descend.

Abalakov spoke slowly and adamantly, according to Craig, saying to reach snow in which they could dig caves.

Craig wrote, “[I]t was implied that if the sick girl could not move and they could not achieve adequate shelter, they must leave her for the good of the group as a whole.”

As the women descended, Irina Lyubimtseva died, apparently freezing to death holding a safety rope for others.

Unable to dig caves in the hard, granular snow, the women somehow managed to put up two tents on a ridge only several hundred feet below the top. The ailing climbers deteriorated. Abalakov strongly directed continued descent by those who could move, according to Craig; Shatayeva said she understood and would try.

The times given vary, but that day or into the next, the ill women (Nina Vasilyeva and Valenina Fateyeva) died. Also that day or, by Shatayev’s account in the early hours after midnight, hurricane-force winds hit, exploding the tents and blowing away rucksacks, stoves and mittens. Five women huddled in a tent without poles, with three sleeping bags.

The next morning four Japanese climbers, bivouacked in a tent at 6,500 meters on the Lipkin side and possessing a strong radio, heard the transmissions in Russian and deduced trouble. Two of the Japanese climbers bravely set out to help but were blown off their feet and forced back. Other climbers on the mountain mobilized, but all were far lower.

Please forgive us. We love you. Goodbye. When will we see the flowers again?

The final hours

The following excerpts are from Craig. Accounts and times differ somewhat, but Craig was in base camp and overall his account is considered sound, and an honest, earnest rendition.

August 7, “about” 08:00. Abalakov pressed Shatayeva as to whether the women were trying to descend. She replied with spirit: “Three more are sick; now there are only two of us who are functioning, and we are getting weaker. We cannot, we would not leave our comrades after all they have done for us.”

10:00 Shatayeva: “It is very sad here where it was once so beautiful.”

Noon. One more had died, two were dying. “They are all gone now. That last asked, ‘When will we see the flowers again?’ [Two] others earlier asked about [their] children. Now it is no use.”

15:30 [Disoriented] “We are sorry, we have failed you. We tried so hard. Now we are so cold.”

Abalakov in despair promised a rescue was underway.

17:00 Transmission unclear, but another woman seemed to have died. Three remained. Winds up high were estimated at 80 to 100 mph, the summit temperatures as minus 30 to minus 40 F.

18:30 “Another has died. We cannot go through another night. I do not have the strength to hold down the transmitter button.”

20:30 “Now we are two. And now we will all die. We are very sorry. We tried but we could not … Please forgive us. We love you. Goodbye.”

Vladimir Shatayev’s book identifies the last speaker not as his wife but Galina Perehodyuk, and suggests it was difficult to understand whether the word was “forgive” or “request.” He writes that twice more someone pressed the radio button, attempting contact with the world.

Steck says, “The events of that day are permanently etched into my brain.” On August 8 the American trio, unprepared, saw the first body on the face below the summit; Wren recognized Shatayeva. Signs of others were visible upslope. The four Japanese arrived at the same time, and the Americans borrowed their radio to call base, with Steck saying, “Something very strange, very sad has happened here.” Finding the other bodies above, they walked crying among them, amid the shreds of tent fabric and shards of poles.

Beyond Shatayeva, two women were half-buried in the snow; three, as Wren was to write in the New York Times, “sprawled across a torn tent, futilely pitched on a scooped‐out snow platform,” and another was frozen holding a rope leading downhill. The eighth was to be found beneath the others when Elvira’s husband and a support crew went up a week later to retrieve them.

That night at camp all three Americans were certain they heard women’s voices. “Russian voices,” says Steck. “We'd open the tent and no one was there.”

The reasons for the mass tragedy are many, sifted through with the benefit of hindsight.

The objective, as a traverse, put the women as camping on the summit, exposed to the worst of the storm. They had poor equipment. They were also under pressure, on show.

“They were the test group,” says Higgins. “They felt they needed to do it to uphold the standards of the women’s team.”

Wren wrote, “Rather than retreat when the storm came in, they made a miscalculation to wait until the visibility improved. I suspect that they did not want foreigners to think Russians were quitters.”

Many observed that Shatayeva felt great responsibility for her team.

Says Blum: “The women were so very loyal to each other. They stayed together until the end.”

Higgins expresses regret, respect and conflicting feelings over the series of events.

“Would it have been braver to say, ‘Let’s save the five of us?’... I just think it was really sad. I’ve felt,” she says honestly, “that she should have taken who she could and gotten out of there.

“It is huge,” she says feelingly of such a quandary. “It is a mortal decision.”

North, the last person to see the women alive (some accounts mistakenly have Scottish and Japanese climbers on the summit with them), says, “You could call them victims of circumstance.

“I don’t think without the international meet they would have been in that situation, in that weather. Same with Eva and Heidi. Because there were so many nations taking part and the overall world situation at that time, it was unusual to be there, so there was a bit of an element of people wanting to represent their nations that does not exist in normal mountaineering situations.”

John Evans (who has just died, January 9), in a published journal, “The Pamirs: Russia,” called the many fatalities “an extraordinarily sorrowful statistic … made even more distressing in the light of the very optimistic and positive intentions of our Russian hosts.” Thirteen were lost: the three Estonians, Jon Gary Ullin, Eva Isenschmid and the eight Russian women.

Anguished and noble

Williamson, in Camp III on Razdelny during the storm, says: “They weren’t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration. I’m just sad those conditions came together. The storm came in pretty fast and went fast. Two days later it was bluebird skies, and we were in shirtsleeves.”

The crucial decision was the one to stay on the summit. Still, a major turning point may have occurred days earlier, in that era when women climbers were often doubted and excluded.

On Peak Lenin, Shatayeva had at first welcomed the snow, on August 4 telling Vladimir by radio, “That’s good—it covers the tracks. So that there won’t be talk that we ascended along a trail” made by others.

Nearing the main ridge August 2, Shatayeva had radioed, “Everything so far is so good that we’re disappointed in the route.”

Yet August 3 she called a rest day. Three teams of Soviet men, one of which summitted August 4, were near, clearly coordinated to provide support if needed. Vladimir Shatayev wrote, “The possibility cannot be ruled out that it was precisely for this reason that the women were dragging out the climb, trying to break loose from the guardianship.”

Had they reached the top one day earlier, they would have been lower when the storm hit.

“They weren’t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration.” Jed Williamson, June 23, 2019.

Now, 45 years on, women have long proved themselves in climbing and mountaineering, are widely visible on the crags and in the peaks, and accepted as peers.

The tale of the Russian women climbers is, as Higgins puts it, “one of the epic sad stories in modern climbing history.”

During the meet, different countries worked together in disastrous and even surreal circumstances. Other people had known the Russian women to be, as Blum put it in her book, “jubilant” on the mountain, and then witnessed an anguished and noble end.

“It is so enormously tragic, occurring at a time when more women were beginning to brave great challenges on rock and in mountains,” Higgins says. ""I wanted to be one of those women, and Elvira seemed invincible.”

""Pretty standard procedure,"" says the athlete who has experienced a far from ordinary 12 months.

Until last March, Harris was admired by many yet not widely recognized. As a young player in the women's Australian Football League (AFLW), a summer sport that is an Australian obsession, her focus had been on flourishing professionally in two sports -- on making a name for herself on the football field and, during the off season, in the boxing ring, too.

But a picture posted on Facebook last year of Harris playing for her team Carlton Blues elevated the then 21-year-old beyond the world of sport. She became one of the most talked-about sportswomen on the planet.

First came the vile messages, and they came thick and fast -- sexist, disturbing and damaging comments posted below a now iconic picture of Harris doing her job.

Harris' fearless response was then shared by thousands on social media, prompting celebrities, and even Australia's Prime Minister, to voice their support. She had stood up and spoken out. It changed her world.

""I would be happy to go through it all again, but I'd rather not,"" says Harris.

With one tweet Harris had made a lasting impression in the usually transitory world of social media, while the photograph is now a symbol of defiance. T-shirts with her silhouette can be bought and a bronze statue of her was unveiled on Australian Women's Day in September.

""I love it when a mum or a young daughter and son says to me 'thanks for standing up to what you stood up for,'"" Harris tells CNN Sport.

""If my example is going to help someone in any way, I would be happy to go through it all again. I'd rather not, but there's been so many amazing messages. It's been an eye-opening experience.""

'Here's a picture of me at work'

It is the opening minutes of the AFLW's Pride Game between the Western Bulldogs and Carlton on March 17, 2019, and Harris, the Blues' forward, has kicked the first goal of the game.

Photographer Michael Willson has brilliantly captured the athleticism of the act: she is mid-air, looking to her left, focusing on the trajectory of a ball which is out of shot. So gymnastically high is her right leg, her right foot is above her head. While a few feet from the ground, she is almost doing the splits.

What followed is said to have changed the landscape of women's sport in Australia.

Posting the picture on its 7AFL Facebook page, Australian broadcaster Channel 7 captions it ""photo of the year.""

Here's a pic of me at work... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals. pic.twitter.com/68aBVVbTTj — Tayla Harris (@taylaharriss) March 19, 2019

Few could have foreseen that the number of, in the broadcaster's words, ""inappropriate and offensive"" comments would lead to Channel 7 deleting the post 24 hours later because, it said, the messages had become difficult to monitor.

But erasing a picture that showcased the prowess of the women's game caused more damage. After all, such an act does not silence trolls.

""THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE PHOTO,"" tweeted Sam Kerr, one of the world's best female soccer players, echoing the thoughts of many. A few hours later, the hashtag ""Tayla"" was trending on Twitter.

At the time, Harris was at home getting ready for bed, ""just doing my thing,"" she says, when her phone started pinging. One notification rapidly following another.

""I didn't think 'oh, this is a really personal attack,"" Harris explains. ""I just thought, obviously this is a much bigger issue than just saying sexist things to people. It's actually the start of something much worse.""

After a phone conversation with the chief executive of a national project which aims to eliminate domestic and family violence, Harris proceeded to post a message which became the most liked tweet of 2019 in Australia.

""Here's a picture of me at work ... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals,"" Harris wrote. The tweet remains pinned at the top of her profile page.

""When I saw a little picture on Facebook and I'd see a young girl with a man who has made these comments, it was horrifying to think that this girl had to live, or be around someone, who is able to actually say these things. I thought about it in depth,"" Harris continues.

""I responded after an hour or two. I thought 'I have the photo, so I'll just put it up and just chuck that caption on' and what happened, happened. I didn't put it up as a f**k you to Channel 7, I just put it up because I thought it was a cool photo.""

Harris speaks next to Carlton CEO Cain Liddle during a press conference at Ikon Park.

Harris went to bed with around 20,000 Twitter followers but by the next morning had an additional 60,000. There was an apology from Channel 7 for sending ""the wrong message"" by removing the photo from its social media accounts, while Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the trolls ""cowardly grubs.""

With a weekend match looming, Harris restricted herself to one radio interview in the immediate aftermath, during which she described the comments as sexual abuse, and held a press conference to sate the appetite of media organizations around the world. Carlton provided her with a security guard for the next game, against Fremantle.

""Surreal,"" and a ""roller-coaster"" is how she sums up the week. ""For the most part it was all positive,"" she adds, ""but I had to check in with myself and make sure this was something I was OK with because it was a really full on and busy, confronting few weeks.

""The really important thing for me was not to dilute the messaging or say something that could be misinterpreted, so I made sure I was really clear and articulate.""

To understand Harris' inner strength, we must step back in time, to the first decade of the century when the self-confessed daddy's girl was growing up in the northern suburbs of Brisbane and towering above her elementary schoolmates. She would grow to become 5ft 10in.

Her father Warren, a marine mechanic whom Harris describes as her best friend, encouraged his daughter to partake in whatever activity she wanted -- skateboarding, building boats, self defense, Aussie Rules -- and with such freedom came confidence and, significantly, courage.

""If I see someone suffering or needing help, I'm already doing something before my brain even knows it,"" Harris says.

""That's something I always have done and always will do. It's non-negotiable for me.

""There was a boy at school who would always pick on a girl who used to be my best friend in grade four because she had a disability. I was a big kid, I was tall, so instead of saying something I would stand physically in the way but, at one point, this boy was relentless so I took him down and, apparently, I pushed him to the ground and held him down and then I found myself in the Principal's office.

""My dad remembers the Principal saying, 'Tayla can't be doing those things because that will hurt the boy's self-esteem.' Dad went off his head. My dad still tells that story, about how wrong that particular incident was.""

Such spirit helped Harris -- who played Aussie Rules with boys until she was told to stop aged 14 -- rise to an elite athlete in two sports. She is unbeaten in seven professional fight and holds the Australian middleweight crown.

Yet like most women in sport, Harris has had to develop a thick skin. She was accustomed to online abuse long before a picture of that kick was posted online.

Her decision to join the Blues from the Brisbane Lions in 2018 stoked keyboard rage but a ""lightbulb moment"" after a conversation with a close friend helped her ride it out.

""He said 'why do you care what someone who you've never met and will probably never meet and have never done anything for you in your life think' so, from that moment, I was like 'why do I care what that weird scummy guy is saying',"" says Harris, conceding that putting up with trolls is likely her lot in life, for the immediate future at least.

Harris has tweeted that she'd give up her AFLW wage to employ a person to monitor online abuse and has called on governing body the AFL to block people who make discriminatory comments from its social media accounts.

Speaking before the death of English television presenter Caroline Flack , which led to the #BeKind hashtag being used on social media, Harris adds: ""It's a pretty messed up online world.

""It's a generational issue. It'll be weeded out in a while when young people come through with the understanding that it's not acceptable to be doing these things.""

Harris (R) fights againt Janay Harding on November 22, 2019.

Her parents, Harris admits, struggle to stoically react to the abuse she continues to receive online.

""They live a plane trip away so (last year) was hard, especially for mum, especially when it was all unfolding as all she wanted to do was get on the plane and make sure I was alright,"" Harris says.

""And all dad wanted to do was go and pay a visit to the people who were making these comments and I guess the rest is best left unsaid.""

Even before that kick was immortalized in bronze in Melbourne's bustling Federation Square, Harris warned her mum not to go online.

""I said to her 'please don't read the comments that are going to be online' because I knew people wouldn't take the time to consider that this statue is about much more than just me,"" Harris says.

""Particular people who didn't take the time to understand what the statue meant were hellbent on saying I didn't deserve this statue. I know I don't deserve a statue as a footballer, but this scenario deserves a statue for a pivotal moment in time that has helped people.""

Harris will forever be known for that photograph, but though only 22 she is not burdened by the responsibility that comes with influence.

""I often get young people who have experienced bullying online messaging me and they've said specifically that I've been the one who's helped them actually call it out, or help their friends call it out,"" she says.

""Bullying online is so bad that young people are committing suicide, which is horrific, so if I can give someone confidence to feel a little bit better about themselves, I will do everything to do that because you just don't know what could've happened otherwise."""/['Aimee Lewis']/2020-03-05 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190320122128-tayla-hairrs-2-super-tease.jpg"

Anti-Semitism ‘My father buried his parents and sister with his bare hands... he had to dig the grave himself.’

(CNN) — Avram Grant remembers the screaming.

It came nearly 50 years ago when Grant, then a teenager, first fully began to grasp the horrors that his father, Meir, had been forced to endure during the Holocaust.

“When I was 15 years old, I was sitting on the balcony of my home with my friend and I heard screaming and shouting,” Grant, the former Chelsea coach, told CNN.

“I had never heard anything like this, not even in Hitchcock movies,” adds Grant, referring to the legendary filmmaker.

“It was a shock for me. My father was shouting, I will never forget it. I said to my mum: ‘Mum, what is happening?’ I saw she was very calm and she touched him and he went back to sleep.

“I remember this day because I took a decision to realize how from this hell came such an optimistic and happy guy. I am telling you that I will never forget it.”

In 1941, Grant’s father fled Nazi-occupied Poland at the age of 13 along with the rest of his family before being exiled in northern Russia, where temperatures plunged to minus 40 degrees Celsius. Only Meir and his brother survived.

“My father buried his parents and sister with his bare hands … he had to dig the grave himself,” Grant said.

“He was 13. This was all because of hatred. That’s why I am always here to speak about it. Always.”

Grant is not only committed to telling his father’s story, but also to educating the next generation. That’s why he has embraced a campaign led by Chelsea, the club he once managed, aimed at eradicating anti-Semitism from soccer and society.

“When you get to my age, you realize there will be nobody left to tell the younger generation firsthand what happened. That’s why it is so important because we are coming to the end of the Holocaust survivor era.”

Grant’s reservations appear well placed.

Lack of Holocaust knowledge

The results of CNN’s 2018 investigation into anti-Semitism in Europe unearthed a number of shocking statistics on the subject of Holocaust education, with a third of Europeans in the poll saying they knew just a little or nothing at all about the Nazis systematic killing of six million Jews.

The outlook was similarly bleak in the US.

A survey carried out on behalf of the Claims Conference in 2018 found that 11% of American adults were not sure they’d ever heard of the Holocaust, rising to one in five millennials. Nearly half of the millennials surveyed could not name a single concentration camp, and 45% of the American adults questioned failed to do so.

In early May, Grant led a delegation from Chelsea and MLS team New England Revolution to take part in “March of the Living,” in which participants were taken on a guided tour of Auschwitz and learned about the systematic mass murder of Europe’s Jewish communities.

The visit was part of Chelsea’s highly respected “Say No to Anti-Semitism” campaign, which was launched in January 2018 under the leadership of club owner Roman Abramovich.

It was in November 2017 that Abramovich, who is Jewish, began discussions with the club’s board about a concerted campaign to fight anti-Semitism.

He was perturbed by the number of anti-Semitic incidents that had taken place across Europe and was eager to take a stand.

It was also an opportunity to educate the club’s supporters on a subject that those who watched the team in the 1970s and 1980s would have been all too aware of, given the anti-Semitic songs and chants that used to be heard at games.

Auschwitz chants

Ivor Baddiel, a Jewish Chelsea supporter, said he stopped attending games temporarily in the 1970s after hearing chants of “Sieg Heil” from a section of fellow supporters and seeing anti-Semitic literature sold outside the stadium.

Particularly vivid are his memories from games against Tottenham, one of Chelsea’s London rivals, that historically has a large following from the Jewish community.

Baddiel says Tottenham fans were often targeted by anti-Semitic abuse with songs such as “Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz” and hissing noises mimicking the sound of the gas chambers used by the Nazis during the Holocaust.

Baddiel also recalls the first time he heard the word “Yid,” a derogatory word for Jew, at a game. At the time, the word was also being used by Tottenham supporters, who wanted to reclaim the word from the racists, and instead, in their view, wear it as a badge of honor.

Even today, some Tottenham supporters refer to themselves as ‘“Yiddos” and the “Yid Army,” despite calls from Jewish groups to stop.

Though shocked by the nature of the anti-Semitic abuse, Baddiel, later resumed attending games.

He has made two videos on anti-Semitism, one focusing specifically on the “Y-word” and the other for Chelsea’s current campaign, both of which he hopes will help educate the public.

“Absurd as it sounds, those guys in the pub who are singing, ‘Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz,’ I think you could even question whether they realize they are being anti-Semitic,” Baddiel said.

“They think they’re being anti-Tottenham.

“I think a lot of people didn’t know it was a racist word for Jews and just thought it was about Tottenham fans.”

Fighting back

Today, Chelsea is one of the most proactive sporting organizations in tackling anti-Semitism, and its “Say No to Anti-Semitism” campaign has already won praise from both inside and outside football.

The club has taken supporters to Auschwitz-Birkenau to educate them about the horrors of the Holocaust, has invited survivors to speak to players and staff about their experiences, and is raising money to help fund a new Holocaust exhibition at London’s Imperial War Museum.

Neil Beard, a Chelsea supporter who attended his first game in 1970, believes the club has helped fans become better equipped to fight against anti-Semitism by providing educational programs and taking them on trips to concentration camps.

Beard, who visited Auschwitz last year with his two teenage children, and also attended a talk by a Holocaust survivor organized by the club in London, says the work Chelsea is doing is having a hugely positive effect.

“I feel we came back as advocates ready to tackle anti-Semitism, particularly where it’s done casually and through ignorance and people think it’s funny,” Beard told CNN.

“It’s not funny. We really need to take it seriously. It’s obviously a global issue with the rise of fascism but as Chelsea supporters and for the club I think we’ve come a long way because it’s now unacceptable and embarrassing among Chelsea supporters to sing some of the songs that were sung during the 1980s, 1990s and even up to today.

“Listening to a survivor had a huge impact on me, trying to imagine yourself in that position and that was harrowing to think you could have found yourself there in that kind of hell. It was so powerful.”

The Chelsea Foundation runs equality training workshops in 75 schools across the UK and ran sessions for hundreds of children in the lead-up to the team’s arrival in Boston for the club’s game against New England Revolution in a contest arranged to raise money for groups tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination.

Bruce Buck, Chelsea’s chairman, insists that while instances of anti-Semitism at the club’s games remain a “very small problem but an important problem” compared to 30 years ago, there will be no letup in the fight against Jew hatred.

He cites the training of stewards in identifying anti-Semitic behavior and the use of CCTV as key aides in tracking down those responsible.

“We’ve come a long way, society has come a long way, but there’s still a problem and I don’t underestimate the problem,” Buck told CNN.

“We are only dealing with the overt incidents and not dealing with those behind the screen and that’s where the other aspect I think of our project, the education part, dealing with that, trying to deal with what’s below the surface.”

Chelsea has cracked down on instances of racism by its fans already this season. Four fans were suspended for appearing to racially abuse Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling last December, while three supporters were barred from entering a Europa League game against Slavia Prague after a video on social media allegedly showed them abusing Liverpool’s Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah.

“We all understand the power of football, the reach of football, it’s extraordinary,” Buck added. “As an American, we think of ourselves as the biggest sports fans in the world and maybe we are, but we don’t have the attachment to our club that you do in the UK which is cradle to grave, whichever club your father supports, you support, and it’s unique. I think it’s true in continental Europe too. So that attachment gives them a loyalty and gives us an opportunity to education.”

'Could take an entire generation to correct properly'

Chelsea’s work has already been commended by sections of the local Jewish Community as well as UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis.

Mirvis believes the role of education, which Chelsea is keen to emphasize as part of its strategy, is key to tackling anti-Semitism though he concedes there is no quick fix. “It could take an entire generation to correct properly,” he told CNN of the fight against anti-Semitism.

“Chelsea is leading the field here and it’s huge congratulations to them. I think the most significant thing Chelsea has done is to acknowledge that there is a problem. That’s very much to their credit. They have taken some concrete and constructive steps.

“It’s an enormous challenge. I think education, the concept, needs to be repeated again and again, together with genuine attempts. Our problem is that we are playing catch up when we are dealing with adults who are already in the stadium. They’ve been conditioned to some degree by their society to think in a certain way and find certain elements of conduct within their comfort zone.”

“When you are talking about changing opinions you need thought leaders, you need influencers.”

Karen Pollock, head of the Holocaust Educational Trust in London, told CNN it had been “humbling” to see Chelsea committing itself to fighting anti-Semitism with direction coming from the very top of the club and being embraced by staff and players alike.

“Footballers are role models for so many and their words and actions have such an impact,” Pollock said.

“Their positive message of inclusion and tolerance is vital in tackling prejudice and hate.”

Pittsburgh

For Chelsea, its arrival in the US could scarcely have been more timely.

An annual report published in May by the Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic incidents in the US remained near historic levels in 2018 after surging the previous year.

According to the latest figures from the ADL, 2018 was the third-highest year on record for assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews since it began tracking such incidents in 1979.

There were a total of 1,879 attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions across the country, according to the report. This includes the 11 people killed during the October 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US.

These numbers are down slightly from the 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, the ADL said.

The decision to visit the US last month and hold a charity match against New England Revolution was made in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack. Both Abramovich and Revolution owner Robert Kraft had already expressed their desire to work with one another on tackling anti-Semitism, but according to Buck, Pittsburgh was the catalyst for the charity match.

Both Abramovich and Kraft pledged to donate $1 million to the charity fund, with a further $2 million being raised through gate receipts. The $4 million pot will be split between 15 different organizations tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination including the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

'Heroes'

Elan Carr, the US special envoy for monitoring and combating anti-Semitism, told CNN that while the attack in Pittsburgh and one at a synagogue in Poway, California, have recently left the Jewish community on edge, programs such as the one deployed by Chelsea and New England Revolution could play a key part in educating future generations on the dangers of anti-Semitism.

“When you are talking about changing opinions you need thought leaders, you need influencers – and athletes are influencers in a way no one else can be. These guys are heroes to kids from rural farmlands to cities, they are adored and worshipped. To have athletes who are so influential stand up and fight for decency and justice, and take positions and say ‘no’ to this scourge of anti-Semitism, a human sickness, and for athletes to say that is unacceptable, that is a game changer,” Carr told CNN.

“This example of what is happening and what Chelsea and New England are doing is a model that can truly change the world,” he added.

'Big power'

Such a responsibility is not lost on the players. Born in Brazil to parents who both worked as teachers, defender David Luiz told CNN that the morals instilled in him during his childhood have helped him become more aware of discrimination within society.

“Football has big, big power to do it and we have to use it in the right way,” Luiz told CNN of the sport’s role in bringing about positive social change.

“I think we are examples for many people around the world and we have to use this power in the right way to make the real difference.

“If you go to the maternity unit you don’t see one baby with a bad vibe. The babies are good, they are cute. It’s the pollution of the world and the system that makes people think in different ways.”

Luiz was part of the squad that visited the New England Holocaust memorial in Boston and also took part in education workshops with local schoolchildren.

On the final day of the tour, he played a part in Chelsea’s 3-0 win at Gillette Stadium with 25,000 fans lending their support to the game dubbed “Final Whistle on Hate.”

Abramovich flew to Boston to watch the game alongside Kraft and visited the locker room afterward.

'I will keep speaking'

"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/04/sport/hoop-dreams-25th-anniversary-spt-intl/index.html"/"NBA: ""Hoop Dreams"" basketball documentary still relevant in 25th year"/"(CNN) When Dwyane Wade was a 12-year-old shooting jumpers on the playgrounds of Chicago, a movie came out that would help navigate him through his future Hall of Fame career.

Released in 1994, ""Hoop Dreams"" shadowed the bumpy fortunes of Arthur Agee and William Gates, two inner-city Chicago youths dreaming of NBA stardom.

Wade's path to the Final Four with Marquette and championships with the Miami Heat would be lined with the same challenges faced by Agee and Gates, including the pressures of injury and young parenting, and the avoidance of drugs and gun violence.

Twenty-five years since its premier, ""Hoop Dreams"" still impacts Wade. ""I watched it many times, and it resonated with me because we all have hoop dreams,"" the recently retired three-time NBA champion tells CNN.

""Growing up in Chicago you struggle,"" he adds, ""I look at ""Hoop Dreams"" and I can see myself in those individuals at the time.""

Film critics like the late Roger Ebert lauded the three-hour documentary f or exposing a side of America rarely depicted at the time: A class system stacked against the poor, coinciding with rising corruption in youth basketball.

Filmmakers Steve James (left), Peter Gilbert (center) and Fred Marx worked on a very thin budget until three years into ""Hoop Dreams,"" when they were able to secure enough funding for the project.

So what has changed since then?

College basketball is coming off a thrilling season, but faces intense scrutiny as a second corruption trial involving shady figures and illicit payments around the sport unravels in court. Meanwhile, Agee and Gates remain close -- bonded not just by their fame from ""Hoop Dreams,"" but two devastating murders in their families.

""You can't script this stuff,"" says Gates, 47, a youth basketball coach in San Antonio, Texas, to CNN. ""Our stories continue to (overlap) like that, because he lost Bo and we lost Curtis.""

Gates' brother Curtis, a former high school star who flamed out, and Agee's father Bo were both featured on screen. Curtis was shot in 2001, reportedly in a dispute over a woman, while Bo - whose redemption from crack addiction and jail time was a seminal part of the film - was killed in a robbery three years later.

""It was very heartbreaking,"" adds Agee, who still lives in the West Side of Chicago, not far from where he grew up. ""It's so eerie that me and William always say ""Hoop Dreams"" was a gift and a curse, and we both lost people that played a big part of our lives.

""And then for both of us not to make the NBA, you know, that eeriness, that gift and a curse is there.""

Though neither athlete played in the NBA, both received college scholarships -- no small feat coming from the dire housing projects they grew up in.

Agee, 46, who attended Arkansas State, went on to play professionally in the now-defunct USBL and had a stint with the Harlem Globetrotters. He then turned to acting, with small parts in a film and commercials.

Agee remains tied to ""Hoop Dreams,"" which provides his motivational speaking platform in schools, and still inspires viewers to send warm messages from places as far off as Australia and China. He also sells apparel inspired by the film, including a throwback jersey from his school days.

Gates was the more heralded of the two, receiving interest from top college basketball programs and a grant to attend the prestigious St. Joseph's high school -- the same school that is shown releasing Agee, seemingly for not playing well enough as a freshman.

But Gates blew out his knee at 16, then rushed back to the court after surgery and reinjured it. Though he played at Marquette University, the injury crippled his pro potential.

""For me, it's bittersweet on many levels,"" says Gates about the film which he has not watched in over 16 years. ""It was a constant reminder of what could have been and what didn't happen, and also a reminder that Curtis is no longer here to hear his voice.""

Nevertheless, he looks back on ""Hoop Dreams"" as a ""life turning situation,"" one that led to an allegiance with Michael Jordan, who invited him to pickup games before his comeback with the Washington Wizards. (An injury derailed Gates' own tryout with the Wizards, however.)

""It has opened doors,"" he says. ""It has done things that I never thought would happen in my life.""

'The first reality show'

What began as a short film idea from director Steve James and producer Frederick Marx to shoot Chicago playground basketball in 1987 with a budget of $2,000 quickly took on greater ambitions.

The pair hired Peter Gilbert as a cinematographer (later added as a producer), and the trio followed Gates and Agee on and off for nearly five years. With 250 hours of footage to edit, the production took seven years in total, eventually raising the $750,000 necessary for completion.

When it was finally released in 1994, ""Hoop Dreams"" went viral, though the term had not yet been coined. It was nominated for best film editing at the Oscars, but snubbed for best documentary and picture, which had critics like Ebert up in arms.

""I've actually gotten way more mileage personally as a filmmaker out of not being nominated than I ever would have by getting nominated,"" says James, who stays in contact with Agee and Gates. ""Over the years a lot more people seem to be upset on our behalf than I was personally.""

By the time it ended its theatrical run, ""Hoop Dreams"" became the then-highest grossing documentary of all time, paving the way for hundreds of sports documentaries and streaming series currently on air.

""I call it the first reality show,"" says Gates. ""I think it was groundbreaking.""

Gates' enrollment in Marquette was mirrored exactly 10 years later by Wade, who also struggled to qualify academically for an NCAA scholarship and sat out his first year for academic reasons, the university confirmed.

Wade shared other similarities with both Agee and Gates, including feeling the pressure to rush back to action after knee injury which required surgery at Marquette. Though the operation was successful, Wade later said it led to complications as a pro.

""I watched it when I was at Marquette from a different (angle), knowing that (Gates) was staying in the same dorm that I was standing in,"" says Wade, who -- also like Gates -- was caring for a child (son Zaire) while in college.

Wade was separated from his mother Jolinda at a young age when she succumbed to drugs , leading to spells in jail. Like Agee's father Bo, she turned to religion after getting clean, now serving as a church minister.

""Obviously, I was able to make it,"" but there are challenges, he adds. ""What I learned at the time is you learn a lot about other people sharing their story.""

William Gates was a 17-year-old high school junior when his daughter Alicia was born.

'Controlled corruption'

Rewatching ""Hoop Dreams"" 25 years later lends perspective to how fast top college recruits are forced to grow up, and how much is at stake early on.

Gates' daughter was born when he was 17, during his junior year of high school. Trying to be a father and student while rehabilitating from two knee surgeries to make it as the next Isiah Thomas -- the former St Joe's and NBA star who makes a cameo in the movie -- became too much to bear.

By the movie's final scene, with his passion for the game already waning, Gates remarks, ""When somebody says, 'When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me,' I should say to them, 'Well if I don't make it, you don't forget about me.""

It's no wonder he needed a break from the sport by his third year at Marquette.

""I didn't feel like a 19 or 20 year-old-kid, I felt like a kid who had been working 10 to 12 years at a job,"" Gates says, estimating that basketball practice and travel would take up to 60 hours a week in college. ""I had a lot on my plate.""

Agee had his own growing up to do, with his academics thrown into disarray after his brief spell at St Joe's, followed by Bo walking out and his mother Sheila losing her job.

In one scene, Sheila cannot pay her electricity bill and the family is left without power, while a clearly humiliated Agee broods at the camera.

(The filmmakers pitched in to get the power back on, leaving that detail out of the film. ""We didn't want to look self-serving, but we felt an obligation to do that much for them,"" says James.)

Agee transferred to Marshall High, leading the team on an improbable city championship and state semifinal run.

In recent years the public high school has been rocked by gun violence , leaving seven former basketball players dead and two paralyzed, including Agee's ex-teammate Shawn Harrington.

""I didn't let St. Joe's defeat me; I didn't let my neighborhood and my environment pull me in to gain drugs, carrying the guns -- that whole lifestyle,"" Agee reflects.

It helped that the teenagers had the right people on their sides. Gates and Agee admit they were given cash during their basketball ascent by the likes of so-called street agents, drug dealers and university affiliates who often helped promising players.

In ""Hoop Dreams"" Agee pays for Air Jordan gear at a store with money received from drug pushers. While at Arkansas State, he says a ""big street pharmacist"" whose team he played for in a high school summer league bought him a car.

""That was part of the deal,"" says Gates of being offered gifts from universities as a highly touted recruit, before committing to Marquette. ""It was like, 'Hey, you need anything let us know.' And you let them know and they took care of stuff.

""Hey I need transportation, hey I need clothes, I need shoes. They figured out how to get it to you,"" he says. ""They did it through a friend of the program that you didn't even know was a friend of the program. That's the way it was.""

In response, Marquette said it ""is committed to the highest ethical standards for the recruitment and retention of our student-athletes,"" while Arkansas State said it had no knowledge of Agee's car purchase and that ""there are too many unknown variables to comment further about a relationship from approximately 25 years ago.""



Arthur Agee was recruited to play at St Joseph's prep school as an eighth grader. A year later he was asked to leave, and his parents were billed for tuition they struggled to pay for.

Somewhat fittingly, Gates is now a full-time coach in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), the collection of summer leagues that insiders say has replaced high school basketball as the launching pad for college prospects.

Among the players that have passed through Team Hoop Dreams are all three of Gates' sons, William Jr., a recent graduate of Houston Baptist University, Jalon, a junior guard at Houston Baptist, and Marques, currently in high school.

AAU has come under fire by an ongoing FBI investigation involving sneaker companies funneling money towards recruits to land at big university programs. The AAU told CNN it does not fund its teams, calling the situation an ""apparel company scandal, not an AAU scandal.""

""People are buying and selling players; it's a human trafficking market."" says Michael Sokolove, author of ""The Last Temptation of Rick Pitino,"" which sheds light on college basketball corruption.

Multiple federal investigations have led to guilty pleas from four college assistants on bribery charges, the conviction of an Adidas executive, and the firing of Pitino from Louisville.

Pitino maintains he had ""no knowledge"" of infractions during his tenure as Louisville's head coach. James Gatto, Adidas' former head of global sports marketing, is appealing his nine-month prison sentence for wire fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with a $100,000 offer to the father of a Louisville recruit.

With athletic wear companies paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to support top AAU programs, the potential to use them as a means to distribute money to the families of top players or an influential coach is high, says Sokolove.

""Some of this is laundered money. These teams can be used as pass through,"" he says, adding that the ultimate goal is to breed loyalty with players who become walking advertisements for the shoe companies on the court.

The stakes have become much higher to land top recruits like Gates was in the days of ""Hoop Dreams,"" notes Sokolove. ""There are more people with their hands in the cookie jar and the kids are largely pawns in this whole endeavor.""

In 2017 the NCAA surpassed $1 billion in revenue, mostly through TV rights, while top players like Zion Williamson of Duke are limited to a compensation of tuition, room and board with a modest stipend.

Like many around the sport, Gates thinks college players need to get paid. He suggests universities contribute $100,000 towards a ""graduation fund"" for the player if he stays in school four years ""to get prepared to live life.""

Gates sees the current NBA age requirement of 19 as an obstacle towards paying black athletes, calling it a ""controlled corruption"" not seen in mostly white sports like baseball, tennis, golf or soccer.

""The two sports that are heavily dominated by African-Americans, it seems like there is always an issue when it comes to money,"" he says. (The NFL enforces a three-year rule before most college football players can turn pro.)

NCAA president Mark Emmert told the Associated Press this month that the organization has ""serious issues which require serious change,"" but paying players will remain unlikely.

'Part of a bigger story'

Coinciding with the movie's anniversary, Gates and his wife Catherine just celebrated their 25th year of marriage. The eldest of their four children Alicia, who was born during filming, is 30 and works as a dental hygienist.

For years Gates would not allow his sons to watch all of ""Hoop Dreams,"" fearing the scenes of his injuries would spook them. He finally relented, though Will Jr underwent four knee procedures of his own in college.

Agee has fathered five children, with his youngest Devin a budding youth basketball player in his own right. Devin's mother Jennifer Genovesi stood by Agee in the wake of a 2017 arrest after a woman accused him of battery.

Agee was quick to call James -- who he refers to as an uncle -- to assure him of his innocence. The charges were dropped shortly afterward.

""I'm part of a bigger story in this film. I never want to bring any despair or negativity into the story,"" Agee says. ""He was like, 'We'll get through it together,' and that was good as that.""

""I feel like they know that I'm here for them,"" says James, the film's director.

The special bond between the parties involved in the film was reflected once ""Hoop Dreams,"" which was never expected to be a commercial success, caught fire. In a highly unusual step, Agee and Gates were made equal partners by the producers.

""They weren't just filmmakers,"" says Agee. ""They came in over a period of time and got to know me and my family, and then stayed in touch.""

Arthur Agee bought his mother Sheila a house with royalties earned from ""Hoop Dreams."" He now uses the film as material for his job in motivational speaking.

Gates and Agee first received nearly $200,000 each, and Agee promptly brought his parents a four-bedroom house in a suburb.

His mother, Sheila Agee, who was seen at the end of the movie graduating tops in her nursing class, relocated to Alabama in the wake of Bo's death.

After Curtis' murder, Gates was given an unlikely last shot at the NBA at age 29 with a tryout with the Chicago Bulls. But bad luck struck again when he caught the flu on the day of the workout.

""I said maybe God doesn't want me to play basketball,"" he reflects. ""That's when my ministry life began to open up.""

Gates received his master's in biblical studies and worked as a pastor at the Cabrini Green housing project he grew up in before settling in Texas.

He is thankful that Curtis got to meet Jordan before he was killed -- another imprint tied to his fame from the film.

""What came along with that was the responsibility to teach, educate, be a friend, have some compassion and show some understanding,"" Gates says.

""I've been very honored, privileged and grateful to be part of ""Hoop Dreams,"" he reflects. ""It's been super amazing to be a part of something that has withstood the test of time."""/['Motez Bishara']/2019-05-04 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150625160830-hoop-dreams-july-super-tease.jpg"
"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/football/cristiano-ronaldo-juventus-social-media-fans-china-spt-intl/index.html"/Has the digital age changed football fans?/"(CNN) Sky Ouyang used to avidly follow Real Madrid, keeping up to date with how the La Liga club was doing from his Shanghai home.

A Real shirt from the 2008/09 season -- Cristiano Ronaldo's first campaign as a Real player -- was a prized possession. But then Ronaldo moved to Juventus and Ouyang's loyalties changed.

Focused flicked from Spain to Italy; to the back of the wardrobe went the Real shirt, in came Juventus merchandise, and immediately it was the Italian club the 23-year-old followed on every social media platform.

""I support Ronaldo first and foremost. The team isn't important, it's whoever he plays for,"" the social media executive, who first fell under the Portuguese's spell when Ronaldo was the young buck at Manchester United beguiling with step-overs and swerves, tells CNN Sport.

Ouyang is not alone in switching his allegiances to Juventus following Ronaldo's $117m summer transfer from a club with whom he established himself as one of the greatest to have played the beautiful game.

With 139m Instagram followers, 74m on Twitter and over 122m on Facebook, Ronaldo is the most followed footballer on social media.

Juventus was the fastest growing European club online in China last month, the number of followers ballooning at a rate which has been described as unprecedented.

Perhaps it should be of no surprise that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, a footballer who has only one equal in Lionel Messi for comparable talent and fame, attracts such zealous following in a country where success and celebrity is cherished.

""There hasn't been an incident like this where there's been fans moving from one team to another or deciding to choose and follow a second team. This is probably the largest shift we've ever seen in China,"" says Tom Elsden, senior client manager at Shanghai-based digital marketing and investment company Mailman.

""In the same period, Real Madrid have lost followers so there's been a direct correlation between Juventus growing and Real Madrid losing followers.""

But the tidal wave of followers which came Juventus' way once it signed one of the world's most famous sportsmen was not merely a Chinese phenomenon.

The Bianconeri has gained 3.5m Instagram followers over the last month, while Juventus' engagements, impressions and followers on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have also rocketed.

Does Ronaldo's digital influence, his power to change a fan's allegiance, mean the nature of football fandom has changed?

If Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi all have a bigger social media following than their clubs, is this the era where the sport's biggest names garner more devotion than the teams for whom they play?

Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, says the cult of celebrity has changed the way football fans around the world associate with teams and players.

""There is the emergence of celebrity culture over the last 15 to 20 years in a way that didn't exist in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s,"" he tells CNN Sport.

""We're now more interested in celebrities than perhaps we are teams and that's a characteristic of not just football and sport but of life in general.""

George Best is regarded as the first British sportsman to be accorded pop star status.

Star footballers have been hero-worshiped since the beginning of the 20th Century and for decades have attempted to capitalize on their popularity.

At the peak of his footballing powers in the 1960s, former Manchester United winger George Best -- a man once dubbed the fifth Beatle -- famously appeared in an advert in the United Kingdom telling viewers that Cookstown bangers were ""the Best family sausages.""

But much has changed since those black and white days when one of the world's most celebrated players helped increase sales in sausages for a family butcher.

Advertising campaigns are more sophisticated, footballers' brands are carefully cultivated, major clubs and their players are lucrative businesses and, crucially, there is the world wide web.

The internet, said Stephen Hawking, has connected us ""like neurons in a giant brain"" and has allowed players and clubs to communicate directly with fans, while in this globalized world almost everything is accessible, from live streaming a match to buying snazzy boots.

If, as renowned journalist Arthur Hopcraft once wrote, football reflects the kind of community that we are then the sport as it is today, and those who follow it, are a reflection of an interconnected world.

Fans wear Ronaldo and Messi masks during the Russia 2018 World Cup.

""There's something in the way in which the social and digital environment has enabled fans to challenge the existing ways of being a fan and perhaps therefore it's breaking down the barriers to fandom that previously existed,"" says Chadwick.

""The role of social media is shaping people's associations and perceptions.

""For many younger people in particular they have less affiliation with a football team that's embedded in the town where they're from and more association with global icons.

""Those global icons can be Manchester United or Real Madrid, but at the same time those global icons can be Kylian Mbappe, Ronaldo or Paul Pogba.""

Teenager Mbappe's goals and blistering forward play helped France win the World Cup in Russia. The 19-year-old, like so many of Generation Z (those born in the '90s and 2000s), hasn't lived in a world without social media.

France forward Mbappe was named the best young player at Russia 2018.

""We've not heard much about brand France or the marketing potential of the French national team. What we've heard lots about is the commercial potential of brand Mbappe,"" says Chadwick.

""There is a focus on the individual and the marketing of those individuals is consistent with Generation Z and the way Generation Z consumes products and associates with brands.

""I don't think we understand Generation Z as well as we should right now. Do we know that Generation Z is even interested in football? Aren't they more interested in social media and filming each other?

""I would stand by my observation that Generation Z is interested in individuals and their point of engagement is around individuals and you see that through the emergence of vloggers and internet celebrities.""

'Portfolio fandom'

Then there is ""portfolio fandom"" as Chadwick puts it, a reference to fans who will support a number of teams, typically one from each major European league, reflecting ""the fluid and open way many of us lead our lives.""

Portfolio fandom has, to a certain extent, existed for decades. Ardent fans of one particular club will often have a soft spot for a team in a different division.

The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media. Michael Calvin

The popularity of the football program ""Football Italia"" which broadcast Serie A matches live on terrestrial TV in the UK in the 1990s helped make following the Italian top flight hipster cool before the word hipster had entered the popular lexicon. That was also, of course, before the English Premier League spread its tentacles across the globe.

Yet even two to three decades ago, the sight of a Barcelona shirt, let alone one with the Catalan club's star player Messi embossed on the back, was rare anywhere outside of the region.

These days seeing children playing in, for example, a Barcelona shirt is common in many neighborhoods around the world. The name on the back of that shirt is also often entirely predictable.

A Cuban boy wears a Barcelona shirt in Havana.

Boys wearing Real Madrid's and Manchester United jerseys sit on a bench in Skopje, Macedonia.

""You hear small anecdotes about kids who might not be Real Madrid fans but they're Cristiano Ronaldo fans,"" says Michael Calvin, an award-winning English sports journalist and author.

""The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media.""

Calvin is referring to the rise of Arsenal TV, a channel which has over 820,000 YouTube subscribers and 285,000 Twitter followers, and personifies how the digital age has given fans a platform to voice their opinions, be it for good or bad.

""I don't feel it's very healthy,"" adds Calvin. ""They've got every right to their opinion but it's an uneducated opinion in many cases.

""The whole phenomenon of fan TV where you get people basically expanding on their prejudices and condemning managers out of hand. I don't think that's a very welcome development.""

Millwall fans outside The Den before a Championship match.

In his latest book ""The State of Play,"" Calvin touches on Millwall, a London-based team in the second tier of English football which, like many of its stature, is not internationally supported.

Those who follow the Championship club do so because such devotion has been bequeathed from one generation to the next.

You're born into being a Millwall fan. With the working clubs it's a birthright. Michael Avery

Michael Avery supports the Lions, as did his father, his grandfather, and as do his two children.

""You're born into being a Millwall fan -- you don't think 'I'll start supporting them',"" Avery tells CNN Sport.

""You won't necessarily get someone who's 30 years old who's just got into football supporting Millwall.""

While the club is one promotion away from the riches of the Premier League, Avery says the majority of fans would not want to reach the promised land if it meant sacrificing the club's identity.

""Millwall prides itself on being a working-class club, a family club. It's never been known for big money transfer, or big wages,"" he explains.

""I do feel 95% of the fan base have heritage in the area. With the working clubs it's a birthright. As lovely as it would be to see Millwall make the Premier League, we don't want to sell that identity as a working-class football club just to make it to the top division.""

This week it was revealed that more than half of clubs in the Premier League could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the 2016-17 season because of the league's bumper broadcast deal.

In 2018, Deloitte said the majority of Europe's 20 richest clubs earn no more than a fifth of their income from 'matchday revenues.'

Clubs are increasingly targeting a global audience by signing lucrative commercial deals and so it should be of no surprise that the way those teams are being consumed has changed.

St. Pauli fans hold aloft a flag with the club's recognizable symbol.

Ed Barrett is a Manchester United fan living in Germany. He also follows St. Pauli, a Hamburg-based football club in Germany's second tier which has not won any major titles but whose 29,500-capacity ground is almost always full.

The anti-establishment club has also developed a global following, with its the skull-and-crossbones symbol proving highly marketable.

""FC St Pauli has an image that allows them to exploit a market niche. As such, they went on a sponsor laden tour of the key US market during the summer. If that helps us pay the bills without increasing ticket prices or selling the stadium name, then that really doesn't bother me,"" Barrett tells CNN Sport.

""Likewise, online content or tours by United to gear towards casual fans in the Far East isn't a huge disadvantage to match-going fans. At worst, a minor irritation if you bother following the club on social media where some of the content seems far removed from the essence of the club.""

Fandom has as many layers as a trifle. It is also complex. Fans come in many guises and the extent of their devotion varies. Not that the supporters themselves seem too concerned about these developing intricacies.

""It's a different kind of fan,"" Millwall's Avery says of the disciples of the global icons.

""As much as Ronaldo and Messi are the iconic image, there's obviously an interest in the brand of football. It's just how times have changed.""

It is the clubs themselves, the global players who have chased new supporters, who are having to adapt the most.

""The formation of the Premier League helped to instigate a culture change not just in English football, but in world football more generally,"" says Chadwick.

""The old days, which we can refer to as pre-1992 before the Premier League, were very conventional. They were much simpler and what that therefore did was create not just one generation of fans but multiple generation of fans.

""But post-1992, a new generation of citizens and consumers began to emerge and obviously this is being driven by globalization and digitalization and so the world of football fandom is now much more complex that it was 20, 30, 40 years ago.

""When you begin to factor in Juventus trying to target fans in China through Ronaldo, you're not talking about old Juventus fans and young Juventus fans, but Chinese fans too.

""What football clubs are faced with is having to understand somewhat the Chinese, Europeans, Americans, Millennials, Generation X, Generation X. There are differences between urban and suburban viewers, men and women.

""For football clubs, which are relatively small organizations, understanding this complexity is a huge challenge for them."""/['Aimee Lewis', 'Michael Calvin', 'Michael Avery']/2018-08-17 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180816134324-ronaldo-tease-super-tease.jpg"

Dubbed the INEOS 1:59 Challenge , this race against the clock -- to be staged in late September or early October -- is being backed by Britain's richest man Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire owner of chemical firm INEOS, which recently purchased British Cycling's Team Sky.

""It's human nature to push boundaries,"" said the INEOS 1:59 Challenge website. ""The drive to learn and achieve more is in our DNA. In Autumn this year Eliud Kipchoge, with support from INEOS, plans to redefine the limits of human achievement by breaking the last great barrier of modern athletics -- the two-hour marathon.""

Last week Ratcliffe and INEOS were accused by environmental protesters of ""sportswashing"" -- using sport to enhance reputation -- an accusation the Briton completely rejects.

Speaking to reporters ahead of cycling's Tour de Yorkshire, Ratcliffe took aim at those who criticized his company's fracking project, claiming the majority of environmental groups he has met are ""ignorant"" of the process, adding it remains a cheap source of energy.

Eliud Kipchoge is expected to take part in the event in September or October 2019.

"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/17/sport/gay-bowl-xviii-nfl-denver-broncos-intl-spt/index.html"/Gay Bowl attracts NFL sponsors and touches lives/"Denver, Colorado (CNN) Magic, it seemed, was possible any time Dorien Bryant touched the ball.

Electric runs like the 98-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown in front of 108,000 at Penn State, or the 95-yard score at home against Northwestern, or the touchdown catches of 53 and 41 yards against Indiana State peppered his college football career.

Bryant left Purdue University in 2007 as the school's career leader in all-purpose yards, setting multiple Big Ten conference records before signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Yet just a year later, the playmaker was out of football, walking away from an offer from the Tennessee Titans and reportedly ignoring a call from the Dallas Cowboys.

""I came out when I was 24 or 25,"" Bryant tells CNN Sport of his decision to live openly as a gay athlete about a year after ending his NFL pursuit. ""It was more of my choice, I didn't try and push it.""

""I never wanted to be a figurehead for a movement; I don't want to be that guy.""

Dorien Bryant set records in four years at Purdue University, but walked away from an NFL contract to live an openly gay life.

For the first time since childhood, Bryant, who also ran track at Purdue, took a break from sports and focused on himself. Football became an afterthought.

""It was either football or being able to live my life the way I want to live my life, and I'm happier than I ever was,"" he says. ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Now Bryant is back in the sport as his true self, featured as the go-to receiver for the 2017 champion New York Warriors at Gay Bowl, the annual tournament of the National Gay Flag Football League.

Fifty-seven teams from 22 cities battled it out in 100-degree Denver weather last month, in seven-on-seven matches that provided a remarkable level of athleticism for a recreational league.

Bryant is one of at least seven players on the Warriors with college football experience, recruited by teammate Wade Davis, a former Tennessee Titans signee who won an NFL Europe title with the Berlin Thunder.

""The competition has progressively gotten better,"" says Davis, 41, a figurehead in the league who takes the Warriors' quest to repeat as Gay Bowl titleholders seriously. ""The other teams have had to figure out how to get better players and better coaching.""

""I'm happier than I ever was,"" said Byrant (#9). ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Over the past 18 years Gay Bowl has grown from a three-team tournament played in the dirt field of a Hollywood high school to a three-day event held in rotating cities boasting 35 sponsors, including United Airlines, Fidelity Investments, Sheraton Hotels and UPS.

Rosters represent a mix of races, genders and sexual orientations -- and welcome straight players, though their numbers are capped by a quota.

Everything is well organized, from the shuttle buses, to the singing of the Canadian and American anthems, to referees in striped uniforms who sound a lot like their NFL counterparts.

Games are governed by a 57-page rule book , and formed by two 30-minute halves, with tackling replaced by the removal of an opponent's flag belt.

""I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would get this big,"" says co-founder Jim Buzinski, ""but now it's so institutionalized. Cities are bidding for this.""

Honolulu, in fact, recently beat out bids from Austin and Toronto for the 2020 games, while New York will host its second Gay Bowl next year.

The New England Patriots were sponsors of last year's Gay Bowl in Boston, with owner Robert Kraft speaking at the closing ceremony. This year the Denver Broncos made a financial contribution and worked with organizers to boost the tournament's reach.

""This shows that an issue the NFL probably would have avoided at some point in the past, thinking it was controversial, is now so accepted in mainstream that it seemed a no-brainer to be a part of,"" says Buzinski, who also co-founded the news service Outsports. ""It is so routine that no one cares.""

""These are all football players and football fans, which is kind of a good business decision. It shows the progress that has been made.""

For most of the 1,000 or so participants of Gay Bowl, the long weekend represents a reunion of friends and a celebration of football -- the sport they love, which in many ways shaped their lives.

""The majority of my friends in DC are in the league,"" says James Santos of the Washington Generals, a former Air Force enlistee who would go on to win this tournament playing receiver in his fifth Gay Bowl.

""I have friends who met in the league who got married. I've been in weddings, birthday parties, and one funeral. They are like my family outside my immediate family.""

Flag football was also a means for Santos and his sister, who plays in the female league, to come out to their conservative church-going parents from Texas.

""How my parents grew up, it was really frowned upon,"" he says. ""You were just not considered normal, you were considered weak and a sissy.""

""That's just not the case at all, so for them to see that type of contact and passion ... it's just eye opening."" Santos' parents now attend their games often and ""are really into it.""

""These are like everyday people that love sports,"" he says, adding that flag football helped dispel damaging stereotypes sometimes associated with the LGBT community.

What would do wonders for the perception of gay male athletes, Santos says, is to be represented by a prominent pro.

""Like Jackie Robinson for black people, or Billy Jean King for women, we need an equivalent of someone like that to come out -- a stud athlete,"" says Santos, who is black. ""It would be okay. They are not going to lose their jobs.""

Gay Bowl participants take a knee during the singing of the American national anthem on the opening morning of the tournament, September 14, 2018.

Bryant agrees. ""Sheer numbers tell you there are a few LGBT players in the NFL and in the NBA as we speak,"" he says, ""it's just that those guys are afraid.""

The former Purdue standout wonders how things may have turned out if his shot at the NFL happened now instead of a decade ago. He points to Arizona State University signing openly gay high school football player My-King Johnson as a step forward.

""There is more of a conversation like that in professional sports now,"" he says. ""It's slow, but it's progress.""

It appears that football's locker room culture -- which nearly drove former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan to suicide before coming out -- must evolve for a gay superstar to emerge.

Bryant's Warriors teammate, former San Diego State strong safety Shaun Rogers, says his personal life took a backseat until his athletic scholarship ended.

""Playing football is always like, how is my team going to respond? How is everyone going to respond?"" says the 35-year-old brand innovator with heavily inked arms.

""I don't want nobody to feel uncomfortable about the situation, so I kind of just suppressed it,"" he adds. ""After college, I just became more open with it.

""There was more freedom, I didn't have to worry about my teammates -- even though they were my friends. I just didn't have to be around that culture.""

Gay Bowl XVIII athletes congregated at a welcoming party at a rooftop bar in Denver, Colorado.

Alongside Bryant, Davis and Rogers are Stephan Benjamin, a 6-foot 4-inch, 211-pound former wide receiver at American International College, captain Preston Roberts Jr. from Worcester Polytechnic, and quarterback Chris Allison from Columbia University.

Gelling with the LGBTQ league's ethos of inclusion, Roberts and Allison are two of the Warriors' five allotted straight players, with no more than three allowed on the field at once.

Both prefer to play in New York's gay flag football league, rather than the ragtag games they were a part of in the city. ""I can't think of a straight league that is on this level doing this type of stuff,"" says Roberts.

""This is legit,"" says Allison. ""First off, everyone's got a jersey. Then you've got the tents (shielding resting players from the sun), you've got websites, you've got first aid here. Everyone's got a plan of action.""

""A lot of these leagues we've played in have been ad hoc, you've seen fistfights,"" he adds, noting that in the gay leagues ""people get a little chippy from time to time with competitiveness. But if there is a fight, you're gone. It's not acceptable.""

During his first practice, the quarterback felt ""a different vibe"" straight away. ""Everyone was super friendly with a lot of camaraderie, and so I said 'Why don't we give it a go?'""

Roberts says joining the New York Gay Football League -- which welcomes ""straight allies"" on its website -- was by way of an understanding with Davis.

""He's taught me a lot about this league and about LGBT, so he's only expanded (my mind),"" he says, ""but he wouldn't have invited me to the league if he didn't think that this is something that I could become a part of.""

""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough.""

Warriors captain Preston Roberts Jr. (right), who is straight, credited the league for educating him on the LGBT community. ""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough,"" he said.

It's the opening morning of Gay Bowl XVIII and players on the vast green field on the outskirts of Denver are slow to get into a rhythm. Maybe a few too many carried on at the welcoming rooftop party the night before.

Bryant, who doubles as a personal trainer for budding college prospects and a bartender in New York, is used to playing on little sleep. ""I get off work on Saturday at like 5 a.m. and we'll practice at like 9 a.m.,"" he says.

Boasting a considerable size advantage, the Warriors dispose of their opponents convincingly.

If anyone on the field is keeping track of which three straight players are playing for each team, it isn't apparent. Enforcement has always been based on an honor system, and by all accounts it works.

""I'm not going to say it's never come up,"" says Roberts of the Warriors' inclusion of high-caliber straight players, ""but relatively speaking, it doesn't. There is a rule for it, but it's not a thing.""

Playing in his fourth Gay Bowl, the former Ivy Leaguer Allison is one of several straight quarterbacks in the league, because -- just like in the NFL -- good flag football quarterbacks are hard to find.

""I'm sure there are a few people who are frustrated about it,"" he says. ""There is definitely a debate there. You have to balance it out and make sure we come to some middle ground where everyone can be happy.""

Buzinski explains why a quota system was implemented after he founded the Los Angeles league. ""We didn't want a situation where a 'gay team' would have 75 percent straight players, and they were the best straight players in high school or college, and they would be ringers.""

""People said, 'Well isn't that discriminatory?' No. You can play flag football in LA or any city in multiple leagues, so they weren't being deprived of an opportunity,"" he notes, adding that he never saw ""a serious violation.""

""People policed themselves."" Besides, ""there was no way we could really test for it,"" he says.

""There were some players that people would swear were straight, and then their boyfriend would show up.""

Joe Cooper of the Denver Summit, who was honored by the league as a Hall of Fame inductee this year, sums up the consensus.

""At the end of the day, you have a lot of gay men who say 'I don't care if he's straight or not, I'm still going to whoop his ass on the football field.'""

Not to be outdone, women have featured prominently at the Gay Bowl since their inclusion seven years ago.

""We're very, very competitive, specifically when it comes to sports,"" says the Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins, who has played on six championship teams. ""We can be a bit brutal with each other.""

New to the city after finishing her tour with the Army, Rollins found flag football ""all encompassing,"" and even met her wife through the league.

""It's really been this amazing experience at an adult time in my life,"" she says. ""I never went to college, so I consider this to be like a college experience for me. I never had this comradery, this sports experience.""

The Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins (right), who won her sixth Gay Bowl, says flag football is ""all-encompassing"" and met her wife through the league.

Before she transitioned to life as a woman, Kaylee Parker played wide receiver at South View High School in North Carolina, battling several top college prospects in the state.

The 38-year-old mechanical engineer moved to Phoenix in 2015 and began living full time as a woman, but missed the competition.

""Originally, I just wanted to play football,"" she says of finding her way onto the Phoenix Fahrenheit, ""and once I started playing, I ended up meeting a lot of cool people, and it's basically like my other family now.""

""It didn't matter to me if it was a straight league or a gay league, but it happened to be what I found.""

Coming from a Phoenix league that is open to all genders, Parker's gender identity has not been an issue. But the Fahrenheit's team captain and quarterback admits she has received some resistance as a trans athlete competing in the women's division of Gay Bowl.

""Everyone has their perspectives,"" she says, adding that flag football is more about finesse, catching skills, quickness and strategy, and less about brute strength. ""So I think that the physicality of it goes out the window.""

(Her sentiment is echoed by Bryant, whose Warriors took fifth place this year. ""It's about who's smart,"" he says. ""You can have the 12 best athletes in this tournament and line up and still lose."")

""I think about it a lot,"" Parker says. ""I wouldn't compete if it was a tackle league.""

The other competitors, she feels, are perfectly capable of facing her across the line of scrimmage. ""I would think that it would discredit a lot of women if I said I wouldn't play.""

Kaylee Parker played high school football in North Carolna before transitioning to life as a woman. The 38-year-old mechanical engineer says her flag football teammates in Phoenix are ""like my other family now.""

Perhaps the game is less physical than tackle football, but it certainly can be rough.

One Warriors player is examined for a possible torn tendon in his knee after the team's very first game, while an LA Express player grumbles to Bryant that he lost a toenail in a collision.

""He acts like I did it on purpose,"" Bryant shrugs to a teammate, after encouraging the player to go to the first aid tent. ""It will grow back.""

Bryant -- who at 33 still sports a six-pack and the unmistakable frame of a pro athlete -- admits he was at first taken aback by the level of play in the league, then checked himself. Was he stereotyping too?

""You know what, you are kind of (surprised) at first,"" he says. ""But then when you step back and think about it, why? Why are we surprised?

""Because they are gay men? Like, we can play,"" he says, eyebrows raised, head nodding. ""It is a recreational league, but we can play."""/['Motez Bishara']/2018-10-17 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181009174924-gay-bowl-tease-super-tease.jpg"

"https://cnn.com/interactive/2020/04/sport/liverpoolpremierleaguetitle/"/​​Liverpool: The agonizing wait for a first Premier League title/"1990 / 91 30 years of dreaming Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football’s biggest prize

Gary Gillespie doesn’t remember how he and his teammates celebrated Liverpool winning the English first division title in 1990. “We probably got together and had a few drinks and reminisced about the season,” the former Liverpool defender tells CNN, chuckling at his hazy recollection.

There was little reason to especially savor that year’s yield, Liverpool’s 18th league title and Gillespie’s third in five seasons, because winning was what the club did. Springtime in Liverpool was the season for picking up trophies.

There was satisfaction and relief, an uplift to the red half of the city after a heartbreaking decade, but not the intoxicating hit on the senses that usually comes with the glory of being the best in the land.

Liverpool, it was assumed, would do it all again in the seasons to follow, or come close at least. No one knew the 1989/90 campaign was an ending, a full stop on what had been an unforgettable sentence in English football history.

“Everybody was used to winning and maybe took it for granted, and, anytime you take anything for granted in life, sometimes it comes back and smacks you in the face,” says Gillespie, “and that’s exactly what happened because we’re talking about this 30 years down the line, and Liverpool haven’t managed to win a title since.”

This year was supposed to be different. Jurgen Klopp’s men were 25 points ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City, within two victories of winning English football’s biggest prize, before the coronavirus pandemic caused the world to pause.

As the 30th anniversary of the club’s last league title success is marked, the wait continues. Agonizing, uncertain, with the story of the club’s revival missing its final page.

‘Managed decline’

1980s Britain. Margaret Thatcher’s decade. The city of Liverpool is fighting for survival.

The docks, once the heartbeat of Liverpool's prosperity, have been in decline since the 1970s. Manufacturing is shrinking, economic stagnation is sharp, the population is in decline, inner-city homes are falling into decay and unemployment is high. The city is also the first in the UK to be hit by the heroin epidemic that will go on to wreck a generation.

“Liverpool was being forced on its knees,” lifelong Liverpool supporter and retired academic Gordon Jenkins, 61, tells CNN. “I remember Chelsea fans used to wave £20 notes at us and say, ‘we’ve got loads of money.’”

On a red-hot July day in 1981, thousands of well-wishers lined London's streets to cheerily wave Union flags in celebration of Charles and Diana's wedding in the English capital. Two-hundred miles away, Liverpool was burning. Appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, had exploded into anger, rapidly descending into nine days of disorder which resulted in hundreds of injuries, arrests and one death.

Widely referred to as the Toxteth Riots, locally it is known as the ‘uprising.’

“This was a city without leadership,” wrote Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister who would go on to construct a framework to revive Liverpool, in his autobiography.

“We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.” Geoffrey Howe, UK finance minister, 1979-83

In the aftermath of the unrest, Thatcher’s closest ministers talked of a “managed decline” of the city, National Archives files would reveal in 2011, with Thatcher's finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, warning: ""We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.""

It was during this decade Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of Britain. Thatcher had polarized and radicalized. A broken working-class city which, historically, had not always leaned to the political left turned red.

But during these divisive times the people had football, two of the country’s outstanding teams in Liverpool and Everton. The beautiful game gave Liverpudlians heroes and hope. Football, says Jenkins, was, and still is, “inexorably woven into the fabric of why we are who we are.”

From 1981 to 1990, the two Merseyside clubs between them won nine league titles, two European Cups, a Cup Winners' Cup, three FA Cups and three League Cups.

Liverpool Football Club had become the bastion of invincibility former manager Bill Shankly had envisaged when rebuilding the club in the 1960s. Shankly’s successors, all appointed from within, had carried the torch. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. Seamless successions upon which a dynasty was built.

“I was there eight years, the worst we ever finished in the league was second,” Gillespie, who left Liverpool for Celtic in 1991, says. “If you finished second it was deemed a failure, you’d had a poor season regardless of what else you’d won.""

The league title was, says Gillespie, the ""be all and end all” and this was especially the case in the latter half of the decade when English clubs were indefinitely banned from European competition following the Heysel disaster in 1985.

“We never got allowed to get carried away,” Gillespie says, identifying the camaraderie formed on boozy nights out as one of the reasons for the club’s success.

“The coaching staff were always calling us ‘big heads’ and any opportunity they had they would try to knock you down. There was never too much praise for us. I don’t think we needed it.

“When we came in after games, we would have to tie our boots so it was easier for the coaching staff to put the boots away. When we took our kit off, we just didn’t throw it on the floor; we had to put the shorts in a pile and the tops in a pile. It was little things like that that kept you grounded.”

A city grieving

Though football saved the city during this decade, it was also the source of unimaginable pain.

On April 15, 1989, Liverpool fans were crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace in Hillsborough, Sheffield, during an FA Cup semifinal. Ninety-six men, women and children unlawfully killed, an inquest would find 28 years later, due to police failings and the criminal gross negligence of the officer in command.

Players had watched the injured and dying being carried away on advertising hoardings used as emergency stretchers and, in the weeks that followed, provided solace for the grieving. At one stage, the 38-year-old Dalglish, by now Liverpool’s player-manager, attended four funerals a day.

Adding to the suffering were the false accusations, published on the front page of the Rupert Murdoch-owned English newspaper ‘The Sun’ immediately after the disaster, that Liverpool fans had urinated on police and pickpocketed dead victims.

“It [the disaster] left its mark on a lot of people,” says Gillespie, conceding that the players still do not like to talk about the tragedy.

At the start of that year, defending league champions Liverpool had been in an unfamiliar position: fifth in the league and nine points behind leaders Arsenal. And, so, the second half of the season was spent in relentless pursuit of the Londoners, with Liverpool eventually bumping Arsenal from the summit with two games remaining thanks to 21 wins in 24 games. Yet the championship was not yet won. The end-of-season title-decider was still to come.

Arsenal’s April visit to Anfield had been rescheduled to the final day of the season because of the Hillsborough disaster, resulting in the jittery Londoners arriving on Merseyside needing to beat their rivals, who six days earlier had won the FA Cup, by two goals to become champions.

No one expected Arsenal to win but this Friday night match under the lights was made legendary as soon as the final whistle blew. In a hallucinatory ending, with seconds remaining and the visitors 1-0 ahead, Arsenal's Michael Thomas burst from midfield and scored, securing an extraordinary 2-0 win -- and the championship -- for the Gunners.

At the final whistle, television cameras capture Dalglish standing silently near the Liverpool dugout, looking into the middle-distance.

“When Arsenal score, you can see a lot of them (Liverpool players) collapse to the floor. They were playing three games a week; they’d been going to all the funerals, and there was a sense that a lot of them were exhausted,” says Gordon.

Business as usual

For those who witnessed it, the 1988/89 season finale lives strong in the memory. But when Liverpool's players returned to pre-season training four weeks later, no one at the club mentioned the Arsenal defeat, or even the previous campaign.

“The coaching staff, the manager, the whole ethos of the club was to never look back, to never linger, regardless of whether you had won the title or lost it. It was just something that was ingrained in us,” Gillespie explains.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade ... it was a remarkable achievement.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

Liverpool’s only major signing that summer was Swedish defender Glenn Hysen, bought from Fiorentina for £600,000 ($670,472).

The new season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 9-0 thumping of Crystal Palace, but this was not a particularly dazzling Liverpool vintage. A 4-1 loss to Southampton led to an indifferent patch and, while Liverpool ended the year topping the table, by March Aston Villa had the initiative.

Meet the 1989/90 squad

Yet Villa stuttered. A home loss to Manchester City was followed by a 3-3 draw with Norwich City and, as any seasoned predator would, Liverpool capitalized. On April 28, 1990, having that day beaten QPR 2-1 at Anfield, Liverpool regained the title.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade … it was a remarkable achievement,” says Gordon.

“We’d been so successful for so long, to say we took it for granted wasn’t quite the case because it was always a great privilege to be a Liverpool supporter, [but] it was like normal service being resumed.”

Relief for a job well done

The smartphone, let alone a wireless network, was still some years from being part of everyday life, so it was left to Anfield’s stadium announcer to inform fans that Liverpool had won a sixth championship in 10 years.

Attending his first Anfield match that day was a seven-year-old John Gibbons. As Liverpool's players walked around the pitch to acknowledge the fans -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the club's idiosyncratic goalkeeper, performing handstands -- Gibbons remembers standing on a seat and serenading the champions to 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'

“It was all fairly understated,” Gibbons, a contributor to the Anfield Wrap podcast, tells CNN. “It was exciting, it was good, but if you’d told anyone in that ground that it would be 30 years until they’d win the next one, they wouldn’t have believed you.”

For the players, soaking up the pressures of expectation was over until the next season at least. “You put 10 months on hold, you give your all for 10 months,” says Gillespie. “Fortunately for us we were normally successful, but I don’t think you can enjoy it [a season].”

English football goes global

But at the beginning of the hedonistic 1990s, Liverpool would learn that even great clubs cannot pause to catch a breath. As Shankly once said: ""Football is relentless ... it goes on and on like a river.""

On the morning of February 22, 1991, with three months remaining of the 1990/91 season, photographers, TV crews and journalists had assembled at Anfield.

The city’s newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, had already prepared its front page because it knew what was to come: Dalglish, with Liverpool three points clear at the top of the table, was going to resign as Liverpool manager.

“Kenny Dalglish as a person has pushed himself to the limit,” said the Scot during the news conference, flashbulbs lighting up his face.

As a Liverpool player, Dalglish had won three European Cups, five league titles and four League Cups and added three more league titles and two FA Cups, including a league and cup double, as player-manager.

But this was a man who had taken on the city’s grief.

In a recent documentary about the man regarded as Liverpool’s greatest player, his family talked of the impact Hillsborough had on him: sleepless nights, mood swings, a rash covering his body, the struggle to make simple decisions.

He had also taken charge of the team shortly after 39 Juventus fans had died before the Italian club’s European Cup final against Liverpool in the Belgian city of Brussels. Supporters, the youngest just 11 years old, killed in a stampede before kick-off in the dilapidated Heysel stadium. It had all taken its toll.

“It all started going wrong when Kenny left,” says Gillespie.

The cracks, which arguably had first appeared when the team suffered an FA Cup semifinal loss to Crystal Palace in 1990, deepened. Celebrated players came to the end of their careers and new manager Graeme Souness made unsuitable, expensive signings.

Thirty miles away great rivals Manchester United were readying to dominate English football’s new age. The birth of the Premier League in 1992 led to a boom: wealth, glitz and the globalization of the English game. Successful on the pitch, United flourished commercially.

This is Anfield: The history of an iconic stadium Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally home to Liverpool’s city rivals Everton, who moved out in 1891. A year later, newly-formed Liverpool started to play there. The stadium, which has four stands, has become one of football’s most iconic venues. In 1906, the famous Spion Kop was constructed. It was converted into an all-seater stand in 1994. Around the stadium there are nods to the club’s past, such as The Shankly Gates, The Paisley Gateway and The Hillsborough Memorial. The Main Stand, built in the 19th century, has been redeveloped in the last decade, boosting Anfield’s capacity to 54,074.







In an interview with English newspaper The Guardian in 2002, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who would guide the Old Trafford club to 13 league titles, uttered a now famous sentence.

His greatest challenge, he said, was “knocking Liverpool right off their f***ing perch.”

With 20 league titles to Liverpool’s 18, the Manchester club can still crow, but United are not the dominant force they once were.

Back on their perch?

Some fans have been known to request selfies on the Kop with Chris Bolland, once they learn how long the 63-year-old has been attending matches at Anfield. A familiar face in the stands since 1966, he remembers plenty of title wins. But neither of his two sons have experienced the joy of watching the team lift a championship trophy.

The family has experienced close calls over the last three decades – second-place finishes under Rafael Benitez and Brendan Rodgers, and last season's astonishing 97-point haul which was eclipsed only by Manchester City -- but during those seasons Liverpool weren't unquestionably the best. Fans dreamed, but never fully believed.

This season, however, Klopp’s men have dropped just five points. Never has a team negotiated a season in England’s top flight in such a relentless, uncompromising manner.

Postponed indefinitely because of the pandemic, no one knows with certainty when or how English football will resume. If the Premier League season were unable to be completed, would Liverpool be denied the championship? For now, that is the unanswered question.

The nervousness which rumbled around Anfield at times last season as the team vied with Manchester City in one of the closest title races in recent memory – though they lost only once, Liverpool missed out on the title by a point – had vanished this season.

Winning the European Cup in Madrid last June, Klopp’s first major trophy as Liverpool manager, had strengthened the fans' faith in the players. They believed. But anxiety increases in uncertain times.

Joy Bratherton, 64, moved to Liverpool in 1974 to be nearer Anfield. Once just one of the few female faces among a crowd of thousands on the Kop, she was enduring sleepless nights even before a global pandemic stopped Liverpool's charge to the league title.

Whether Liverpool will win the Premier League is, she says, ""the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the nighttime.""

""I am having very mixed dreams when I doze off,"" she adds, speaking to CNN days before the UK was put into lockdown. ""The strain and stress of the last two seasons has been overpowering.""

It was after comfortably beating Manchester United in January that the first chants of “we’re going to win the league” echoed around Anfield. A new banner also popped up in the stands at the beginning of the year with the sentence, “This Bird Is Getting Back On Its Perch.”

But the deaths and suffering caused by coronavirus have changed perspectives. Dreams of winning a first league title in 30 years are no longer all-consuming.

“You’ll Never Walk Alone is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

""Not being able to be crowned champions for the foreseeable future is completely irrelevant. It absolutely doesn’t matter,"" says Jenkins.

""Jurgen Klopp, who is Bill Shankly reincarnated, has said football is the most important of the least important things and that just nails it completely. 'You’ll Never Walk Alone' is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent. It’s not just about Liverpool people, it’s about people generally.

""If we didn’t win the league because it was voided, that would be unfair but not a disaster. The real wait is for when we can all go to the match again. That wait is more painful than whether we win the league or not."""/[]//"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/04/sport/liverpoolpremierleaguetitle/media/images/card.jpg"

Liverpool's transformation has been extraordinary. Few thought that the club which once ruled English football for such a prolonged period that it became dynastic would ever again wear the crown. Decades of disappointment and false hope had lowered expectations. Even optimists had become skeptics. By the time Jurgen Klopp took charge, the empire had long since fallen

When Klopp succeeded Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool boss in October 2015, the team was 10th in the table and had been thumped 3-0 at home by West Ham that season. Twenty-five years had gone by since the club last won a league title and another championship felt as elusive as the unicorn.

The scars of almost winning the title in 2014 had not healed and key members of that team were gone. Steven Gerrard had moved to Los Angeles, Luis Suarez to Barcelona

But the charismatic German with the extra-large personality promised change and raised the decibels. Though it has taken him five years to win English football's biggest prize, Klopp's impact on Liverpool was immediate.

""We have to change from doubters to believers. Now,"" were his striking words in his first interview as the club's new manager. Even before he had overseen his first match, his charm and positivity gave weary fans hope.

Klopp is unveiled as Liverpool's new manager during a press conference at Anfield on October 9, 2015.

The man from the Black Forest was held in higher esteem than the Liverpool players he had inherited. Having taken over Borussia Dortmund when the club was mid-table and financially hampered, he had twice guided the club to the Bundesliga title, including a league and cup double in the 2011-12 season.

His then new tactics of high, concentrated pressing all over the pitch had not only turned Dortmund into winners, but had gained admirers all over the world.

""When he signed, all the fellas from work, we couldn't believe it, because he was bigger than the club at the time, he was bigger and more well-known than any player we had,"" Dan Fieldsend, author of ""Local: a club and its city. Liverpool's social history,"" tells CNN Sport.

""His words were perfect, like poetry. This is a city of dreamers. So, when he [Klopp] said my aim is to get Liverpool to the top of the table in five years and to win a trophy in three years, that was just everything we'd longed to hear for a long time.

""Klopp was more far-sighted than even the fans at the time. The board as well, they had a vision. That philosophy of never accepting second best, we had kind of forgotten as a fanbase.""

Klopp is tossed in the air by his players after winning the league title at the end of the Bundesliga match between Dortmund and FC Nuernberg on April 30, 2011.

Despite his passion, his words and his past successes, the task before Klopp was Herculean. The opposition was extraordinarily wealthy, and better than his team. There were also question marks over whether Klopp's high-octane tactics could succeed in a league where there was no winter break.

Liverpool's was a squad which clearly needed to improve, but In Klopp's first game in charge, against Tottenham, the team at least played with more energy -- running further than they had in any other match that season -- and there was one detail he could quickly affect, regardless of the personnel at his disposal: the Anfield atmosphere.

The man who can gesticulate as wildly on the sidelines as a broken windmill in a storm sought first to energize the supporters.

""Sometimes, he almost challenges the fans,"" John Gibbons, contributor to the podcast Anfield Wrap, tells CNN. ""He's probably told us off more than any other Liverpool manager. He's headmastery in a way, but he's a headmaster you want to please.""

It was after a 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, his first loss as Liverpool boss, that Klopp told the assembled media that he felt ""pretty alone"" at the sight of Liverpool fans leaving after Palace's 82nd-minute winner.

A month later, following an inauspicious 2-2 draw with West Brom, Klopp and his players saluted the Anfield crowd, which garnered some sneering from observers unable to fathom why scrambling a draw to lowly West Brom was worth celebrating. Klopp would reveal that he wanted to thank the fans for the ""best atmosphere since I came here.""

""He got stick for it,"" says Gibbons of that West Brom celebration. ""But he was saying to the Kop 'this is what happens when we all stick to together, the players will keep going if you do.'

""There's something about him that you trust. He's a leader and he'd be a leader in whatever he decided to do. He could run a bank and he'd be brilliant.""

Klopp (2L) leads his players in saluting the crowd after drawing against West Bromwich Albion at Anfield on December 13, 2015.

It was Christian Heidel's gut instinct which launched a career which now not only consists of Bundesliga titles and a Champions League trophy, but a historic Premier League title, too.

With Mainz desperate not to drop to the third tier of German football, in February 2001 Heidel, the club's then sporting director, offered Klopp the chance to go from player to coach. Klopp was studying for a degree in sports business at Goethe University when he secured his first full-time contract as a player, aged 23 at Mainz, but had no managerial experience.

Heidel has since said it was a decision ""made with the stomach and not the head."" Klopp was not the captain of the team but was, said Heidel, its ""emotional leader.""

Eight weeks into the job, Klopp had secured Mainz's safety and, in the years that followed, took the club and its fans on an unforgettable journey, culminating in promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history.

Klopp celebrates promotion as Mainz manager.

Several influences shaped Klopp: his mentor Wolfgang Franks, the late Mainz coach, whose tactical path Klopp followed; his father Norbert, a traveling salesman and former amateur goalkeeper, who instilled in him a love of sport, while his Mainz teammates are said to have upheld his belief that hard work and intelligence can compensate for a lack of skill.

In Raphael Honigstein's book ""Klopp Bring The Noise,"" Peter Krawietz, Klopp's second assistant coach at Liverpool, said Klopp learned an ""incredible amount about the thing that make a football team tick"" at Mainz.

""He's taken all these years in the dressing room, reflected on them and found that many things can be sorted with a bit of common sense. He has a feel for the situation, for saying the right thing at the right moment in the right manner,"" said Krawietz.

It was his captivating manner which made him a successful football analyst for German broadcaster ZDF during the 2006 World Cup in his home country. Still a second division coach and someone who had not won a significant trophy as either player or manager, he nevertheless connected with the audience.

Lutz Pfannenstiel, analyst for ZDF for the 2010 World Cup, has shared a television studio with Klopp and is not surprised his former colleague has become a success in England.

""He's extremely passionate, extremely direct, extremely funny,"" Pfannenstiel, sporting director at Fortuna Dusseldorf, tells CNN Sport. ""He's obviously very emotional but when he talks about football he doesn't try to be a smart-arse. He always says it how it is, what you see is what you get. He has that unbelievable skill to motivate people.

""He's the exact opposite of arrogant. He's like a general. In the film ""Gladiator,"" whenever the guy put up his sword and said, 'we're going to a war now,' they would just blindly follow him. That's somehow what he is without a sword.""

There is a German word for people like Klopp: Menschenfanger, someone who can talk people into doing things they themselves did not feel possible. It is why players take to heart his all-or-nothing approach and why fans would no longer countenance giving up on the team if they needed an improbable number of goals in the dying minutes of a match.

""Everyone likes being told they're important and Jurgen is really good at that. He tells the players how brilliant they are but also us, so you turn up at Anfield feeling like you're a participant,"" says Gibbons.

Klopp celebrates with the Champions League trophy at Estadio Wanda Metropolitano on June 1, 2019.

""I give everything. I expect my players to give everything. Then we see what we get. That creates the mentality of the team,"" said Klopp in a recent interview.

Klopp has been given time and the funds to succeed at Anfield, and the fans were patient because they had faith.

Though Liverpool did not instantly challenge for the league under him -- in his first season the team finished eighth -- each year there was progress; in the players bought, in the manner they played and in league positions: eighth, fourth, fourth, second, first.

There has been some angst -- Klopp lost three finals with Liverpool before winning the Champions League last year, his first silverware as Liverpool manager. And when Liverpool missed out on the title last season by a point there were those who wondered whether Klopp and his team could rebound from such agonizing failure.

The team's response was emphatic and a 30-year wait has been ended by a commanding margin. The man who gives everything asked his players and fans to match his mentality and everyone has reaped the rewards."/['Aimee Lewis']/2020-06-25 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200625115534-klopp-tease-super-tease.jpg"
"https://cnn.com/2020/06/25/football/liverpool-premier-league-title-spt-intl-gbr/index.html"/Liverpool wins English Premier League for the first time in club's history/"(CNN) Liverpool has had to wait longer than anyone could have predicted, but the club can once again call itself the best in England.

There have been years in the wilderness, a few near-misses and, just when Jurgen Klopp and his men were six points from securing the club's first league title in 30 years, a global pandemic brought this season's procession to a halt.

But the return of football in England earlier this month after a 100-day absence revived a title bid which was only put in doubt when the season was put on pause.

After Liverpool's impressive 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on Wednesday, Manchester City needed to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Thursday to delay the coronation. But the defending champion's failure to claim three points -- City was beaten 2-1 in London -- ended the wait. Pep Guardiola's team must now pass on the crown.

Liverpool, a team which had previously won 18 league titles but none since 1990, has now won the English Premier League for the first time, taking it to within one title of equaling Manchester United's record of 20 first division titles.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Klopp described winning the title as ""absolutely incredible.""

""I have no words. It's unbelievable. Much more than I ever thought would be possible,"" he said. ""Becoming champions with this club is absolutely incredible. It is an incredible achievement of my players ... and a pure joy for me to coach them.""

Fans celebrate outside Anfield.

Though lockdown restrictions are easing in England, Liverpool fans will not be able to celebrate as they had envisioned a few months ago. Who knows when it will be safe to hold a parade through the city?

A number of supporters gathered outside Anfield to rejoice in their team's historic achievement, while the squad itself were together to enjoy the moment the final whistle blew in Stanford Bridge.

But the more subdued celebrations do not mask the enormity of the feat.

What Klopp and his team have achieved is remarkable. Defeated just once, Liverpool has been the dominant team of the season. The Merseysiders lead second-place City by 23 points and, by the end of the campaign, could amass a record points total of 107. No team has won the title with seven games to spare.

Liverpool fans celebrate their team winning the Premier League title outside Anfield.

When Klopp joined the club in October 2015, Liverpool was 10th in the table, struggling to score goals and had collected 12 points from eight games. There were wealthier teams, better teams, in the EPL. Thoughts of winning another league title seemed fanciful.

""We have to change from doubters to believers,"" said Klopp in his first interview as Liverpool boss. It was a statement which raised eyebrows, but one which also energized the club's enormous fanbase. Few could have imagined, however, the progress the club would make under the charismatic German.

Fans outside Anfield, celebrating Liverpool's historic win.

There have been expensive signings; record fees for a goalkeeper and a defender, but even before those purchases were made, Klopp's tactics had resulted in progress. Now, no team in the country plays with such intensity and energy. It has the best defense in the league, a hypnotic forward triumvirate and a tireless midfield.

In every season but his first, the manager has steered his team into the Champions League, reaching the final twice, and every player under his tutelage has improved, from academy graduates such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, to more surprising signings like Mo Salah and Andy Robertson. There have been few flops.

And, finally, after three failures in cup finals, Liverpool won its first silverware under Klopp last season, when the team beat Tottenham in the Champions League final.

It was a victory which strengthened the fans' faith in the team, easing concerns that this was a squad of nearly-men, as Liverpool had also that season narrowly missed out on the title by a point, despite accumulating a club record total of 97.

Since that summer night in Madrid, the team has gone on to win the Club World Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and now the most coveted trophy of all.

That Liverpool would bounce back from last season's agony to win the title the following season in such ruthless fashion is testimony to the team Klopp has built. But, as the man himself once said, the players he has assembled are ""mentality monsters.""

Klopp has earned the right to be regarded among the finest managers in this storied club's history. It is not without reason that many liken him to Bill Shankly, the former manager who rebuilt the club in the 1960s and laid the foundations for what became a footballing dynasty in the following two decades.

""He's been fantastic and epitomizes everything the club stands for,"" Kenny Dalglish, the last manager to guide Liverpool to the title, told BT Sport after a Christian Pulisic strike and a Willian penalty had secured victory for Chelsea.

""It's not just a one-off because last year they came within a point. Onwards and upwards and, I think, we've a lot more happy days to look forward to as long as Jurgen is there.""

Liverpool is a club which has enjoyed much success, but nothing in its glorious past quite compares to the exceptional season this outstanding team has produced."/['Aimee Lewis']/2020-06-25 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200625201334-jurgen-klopp-super-tease.jpg"

World No. 4 Koepka dropped out after his caddie tested positive for Covid-19, and Simpson, who won last week's RBC Heritage, withdrewout of an ""abundance of caution"" after one of his family members tested positive,

The other golfers who withdrew are Cameron Champ, Graeme McDowell and Koepka's younger brother, Chase Koepka, with Champ being the only one out of the five to test positive . McDowell withdrew after his caddie also tested positive.

Brooks Koepka, 30, said that he decided to withdraw to protect his fellow competitors and everyone else involved in the Travelers Championship this week.

""I haven't tested positive for COVID-19, but as I've said all along, I'm taking this very seriously,"" Koepka wrote in a statement posted to his Instagram account. ""I don't want to do anything that might jeopardize the health of any player in the field or his ability to compete.""

Despite three positive tests, Monahan announced that the tournament, which is set to tee off on Thursday in Connecticut, will go ahead as scheduled with no fans in attendance.

""I think we all need to remind ourselves that we're all learning to live with this virus and we all need to learn to live with this virus, both as individuals, as family members and certainly within our businesses. It's pretty clear that this virus isn't going anywhere,"" Monahan said.

Organizers with the PGA Tour assured fans that it would ""continuously reinforce to all players, caddies, staff members and support personnel on property at PGA Tour events to adhere to social distancing and other safety protocols that further minimize risk,"" according to a statement.

The new coronavirus cases didn't seem to worry English golfer Justin Rose too much.

""I still feel safe and there are great procedures in place,"" Rose told CNN's Don Riddell. ""That's where I think golf has an advantage over other sports. We're not in close contact with our competition. There's many golf clubs now open around the world with certain procedures and precautions in place and I'm hoping that that is a benefit for us, but we need the guys to continue to stay safe and healthy.""

PGA's insistence to hold the tournament as planned comes as much of the US sees a rising number in new coronavirus cases. At least 25 states have recorded higher rates of new cases compared to last week and some states, such as Florida, have been seeing record-high averages of new coronavirus cases per day.

"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/20/sport/climate-change-sport-intl-scli-gbr-spt/index.html"/The sporting opponent that could beat every single athlete/"(CNN) The climate crisis threatens the very future of major sports and sporting events around the world, while the global sports industry is failing to address its own emissions, a new report has found.

In the future, almost all sports, including tennis, rugby, athletics, cricket, football and winter sports will suffer the impact of a warming world, facing heatwaves, floods, fires and rising sea levels, the study released Saturday by the Rapid Transition Alliance found.

Almost a quarter of English league football grounds can expect flooding of their stadiums each year by 2050, while one in three British Open golf courses will be threatened by rising sea levels, the study said.

Meanwhile the Winter Olympics , along with other winter sports, will become increasingly difficult to host because of rising temperatures, the report warned.

The area around the International Stadium Yokohama is deserted as Typhoon Hagibis approaches on October 12, 2019 in Yokohama, Japan.

Heatwaves and heat stroke will threaten the health of both players and fans, extreme weather events and sea level rise caused by climate change will flood stadiums and playing fields, and sea level rise will threaten golf courses, the report warned.

Extreme weather events, which are linked to rising temperatures, have already affected major sports events around the world: Typhoon Hagibis wreaked havoc in Japan and at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, while in Australia, smoke from bushfires ravaging the country disrupted the Australian Tennis Open earlier this year.

The study, released Saturday, found that sports leaders were largely failing to address the crisis, or their part in creating it.

The report authors warned that global sport's carbon emissions are equivalent to that of a country the size of Angola by lower estimates, and Spain at upper estimates.

The horizon is covered with thick smoke haze in Melbourne on January 15, ahead of the Australian Open tennis tournament.

But in spite of this, there has been a ""woefully inadequate"" response from the sporting industry the report authors said, noting that only a ""tiny fraction"" of the world's leagues, federations, tournaments, clubs and sporting bodies had made carbon targets, outlined their environmental commitments or signed up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework.

Meanwhile, petrochemical companies, airlines and vehicle manufactures still maintained a presence as key advertisers and sponsors of sport, the study said.

""Sport provides some of society's most influential role models. If sport can change how it operates to act at the speed and scale necessary to halt the climate emergency, others will follow,"" Andrew Simms, coordinator of the Rapid Transition Alliance, which published the report, said in a statement.

""A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles. At the moment sport is part of the problem, but it can become part of the solution,"" he said.

Report author David Goldblatt said that while widespread changes need to be made on a global scale to address the climate crisis, the sporting industry could spark a sea change if it committed to addressing climate change.

""Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single mega city, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total. Yet few human practices offer such an extraordinarily large, global, and socially diverse constituency as those playing and following sport.

""Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,"" he said.

Scientists have repeatedly warned that urgent steps must be taken to stave off the worst effects of climate change."/['Amy Woodyatt']/2020-06-20 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200620085534-01-premier-league-muddy-pitch-file-super-tease.jpg"

"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/27/sport/kobe-bryant-legacy-spt-intl/index.html"/Being a great basketball player wasn't enough for Kobe Bryant/"(CNN) Kobe Bryant left the NBA on his own terms on April 13, 2016, scoring 60 points -- more than any other player in a game that season -- in a win over the Utah Jazz as he drew the curtain on his historic 20-year career.

On Sunday, the 41-year-old tragically left the world in a helicopter crash outside of Los Angeles, California that killed nine people including his 13-year-old daughter Gianna.

The outpouring of tributes from those in and out of basketball, including Barack Obama, Rafael Nadal and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Shaquille O'Neal, provide a glimpse into how Bryant's legacy will be shaped after his death.

Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash that killed nine people including his 13-year-old daughter Gianna on Sunday. The Lakers legend leaves a formidable legacy on and off the court.

On the court, he will go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game, winning five championships, two NBA Finals MVPs and two Olympic gold medals, while finishing fourth in career scoring -- he was surpassed by current Lakers captain LeBron James on Saturday.

Off the court Bryant was many things: An intellectual who switched effortlessly between Italian, Spanish and English; a doting father to four daughters, a budding media mogul who won an Oscar, a fervent soccer fan of Barcelona and AC Milan, a champion of women's sports, and an inspiration to younger players for his winning attitude that he labeled ""Mamba Mentality.""

However, his sexual assault charge stemming from a 2003 incident in Colorado, which was dropped and t hen settled out of court in a civil suit, complicates his legacy in the #MeToo era and led to protests after his Oscar win in 2018.

But the experience, which cost him millions of dollars in endorsement deals at the time, also developed him as a person and allowed the release of the non-apologetic and at times overly brash competitor in him, he later said.

Bryant (L) modeled his basketball game after Michael Jordan, who he turned to for advice as a budding star and as a veteran facing retirement.

Growing up with 'vengeance'

Bryant was the son of former NBA player Joe ""Jellybean"" Bryant, who transitioned to the Italian league when his son was just six years old.

It was in Italy where Bryant's love of soccer was shaped and where he also experienced racism.

""When I was growing up in Italy, I've obviously witnessed it first-hand going to certain soccer matches and things of that nature,"" Bryant recently told CNN's Andy Scholes.

""My parents have taught me and educated me on how to deal with those sorts of things.""

Brazilian star Neymar paid his own tribute to Bryant after scoring for PSG against Lille on Sunday.

Growing up in Italy shaped the younger Bryant both socially and competitively, he said.

""Our parents immersed us in Italian culture. We were just surrounded by Italian kids. We were just learning the language as they were,"" he told O'Neal in an interview for TNT in 2018.

That is also when his killer instinct began developing on the court.

""A lot of it had to do with isolation, growing up over there and being the only African-American kid ... I gravitated towards the game and in that game you find solace,"" he said.

""And when you play with kids that may not accept you because you're an outsider, that's my chance to get vengeance on them for not accepting me. And that's where it started developing, and throughout the course of my life it's always been that.

""It's always been the outsider who is coming in to prove (something) or seek some kind of vengeance,"" he added. ""I always had ambition.""

Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act. To lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 26, 2020

Bryant would grow to become a 6-foot 6-inch scoring phenomenon as a Philadelphia high schooler. He was the first guard to be drafted directly from high school to the NBA in 1996 as the 13th overall pick by the Charlotte Hornets.

Lakers general manager Jerry West had his eyes set on the 18-year-old, however, and traded for him in a deal that was overshadowed by the team's splashy signing of O'Neal.

The dynamic pair would go on to win three NBA Finals from 2000 to 2002, with O'Neal very much the alpha of the team. By the time the Lakers lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals, however, friction had come between the two superstars who were barely on speaking terms.

The difference between their offseason work ethics was largely to blame, with Bryant calling O'Neal ""fat and out of shape,"" before the start of their final season.

""I'll admit a lot of times I didn't come into camp ready ... because I had you, I was able to chill out in the summer,"" said O'Neal, who patched things up with Bryant, in the TNT interview. ""That's what pi**ed me off; my (butt) was in the gym 10 hours a day,"" Bryant responded.

O'Neal was traded to Miami and the Lakers were rebuilt around Bryant, who would bring a further two championships to Lakers Nation alongside Pau Gasol in 2009 and 2010.

Kobe Bryant (L) celebrates with Shaquille O'Neal after winning the 2000 NBA Championship against the Indiana Pacers. The two superstars would be undone by a personality clash after their fourth trip to the finals, but became friends in retirement.

The birth of The Black Mamba

O'Neal's departure from the Lakers coincided with the end of Bryant's trial in 2004, which relieved the team from the media frenzy that had dogged it throughout the preceding season.

The sexual assault criminal trial was dropped when the unnamed defendant chose not to testify, but Bryant paid an undisclosed amount in a civil suit settlement and apologized to her publicly.

""Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did,"" he said in a statement read by his lawyer.

Bryant reflected on the incident to the Washington Post in 2018, noting that it changed his personality both on and off the court.

His coping mechanism, he said, was to create an alternate personality for himself, a ruthless character known as ""The Black Mamba,"" a name he derived from a scene in the movie ""Kill Bill.""

He inked his first tattoos and played with a noticeable scowl aimed at opponents and lagging teammates.

""I don't know what would've happened had I not figured it out, because the whole process for me was trying to figure out how to cope with this,"" he said. ""I wasn't going to be passive and let this thing just swallow me up.

""You've got a responsibility: Family, baby, organization, whole city, yourself -- how do you figure out how to overcome this? Or just deal with it and not drown from this thing? So I was bound to figure something out because I was so obsessively concerned about it.""

In ensuing years, Bryant would become prolific on social media and sign off on many posts with the hashtags #mambamentality and #mambaout.

He wrote his book ""The Mamba Mentality: How I Play,"" and christened his Mamba Sports Academy in 2018.

NBA players on other teams looked to Bryant for inspiration. Before hitting his game-winning shot to ice the 2016 title for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Kyrie Irving spoke with the Lakers legend to get in the right frame of mind.

""I had been speaking to him throughout the entire playoffs and during the season,"" Irving told ThePostGame. ""I actually FaceTimed Kobe after the game as soon as I got in the locker room ... (it) was just a great thing, knowing how he has won five and I just won my first.

""Then realizing how hard it is just to win one, my respect for him is already high, but it went to another level knowing that he's got five of them.""

In a nod to Bryant's influence on a new generation of competitors, ""Mamba mentality"" along with Bryant's #24 was scribbled on the shoes of 15-year-old tennis star Coco Gauff as she played a doubles match at the Australian Open on Monday, while Nick Kyrgios warmed up for his match wearing Kobe's old No. 8 jersey -- both uniform numbers have been retired by the Lakers.

'What am I going to do with the rest of my life?'

Bryant hobbled through his final few seasons, suffering from a torn Achilles tendon in April 2013 and torn rotator cuff in January 2015, and began thinking about the next phase of his life and interests outside of basketball.

A lifelong soccer fan, he formed ties with his favorite teams and players from Barcelona and AC Milan -- notably Neymar and Ronaldinho -- attending practices when his schedule allowed it.

He also became a champion of women's sports -- Bryant was visibly in the stands at Wembley Stadium when the Team USA women's soccer team won gold at the London 2012 Olympics -- and attended WNBA games with his daughters.

Notably, he would run Gianna through basketball drills, some of them posted on social media, with his second-eldest daughter displaying the same fierce competitive spirit as her father.

He launched a branding company, Kobe Inc., in 2014 and later the multimedia production company Granity Studios. Then he won the Oscar in 2018 for Best Animated Short Film based on his open retirement letter, ""Dear Basketball.""

Bryant won the Best Animated Short Film award for ""Dear Basketball"" at the 2018 Oscars.

Leaving a legacy outside of basketball was clearly as important to Bryant as his achievements on the court. But how could he match the thrill of scoring 81 points in a game, something only one other person in history had achieved?

""I was in Milan and wanted to meet with Giorgio Armani and talk to him a little bit about how he built his business,"" Bryant said as he announced his retirement in 2015. ""He started to build his business at the age of 40, and I was 21.

""I said to myself, I'll probably play to 35, 36, whatever the case may be. He built a whole business at 40. What am I going to do with the rest of my life? What comes next?

""From that point on, I started figuring things out, trying different things. Dabbling in this, dabbling in that, trying to figure out what exactly that passion is,"" he added.

""It's not as easy as basketball, because I was born to play basketball and had to really work to figure out what comes next.

""That's really hard, man; really, really hard. But that's what we as athletes have to figure out."""/['Motez Bishara']/2020-01-27 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200127110655-kobe-bryant-4-profile-shot-super-tease.jpg"

"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/24/football/burnley-white-lives-matter-banner-wajid-khan-neil-hart-emile-heskey-spt-intl/index.html"/'White Lives Matter' banner was to 'incite racial hatred,' says Burnley FC CEO Neil Hart/"(CNN) English football seemed to be united. When the Premier League restarted earlier this month, all the players from 20 clubs took a knee and some raised their fists, paying homage to a symbol of the Black power movement. For the first 12 games players also wore shirts with the message ""Black Lives Matter"" on the back of their jerseys instead of their names.

Then on Monday a more discordant note was struck -- a plane flew over the Etihad Stadium during Manchester City's game against Burnley trailing a banner displaying the message: ""White Lives Matter Burnley.""

Burnley condemned the banner, issuing a statement during the match to offer its unreserved apology. After the game, Burnley captain Ben Mee said he was ""ashamed and embarrassed.""

According to the the Mayor of Burnley, Wajid Khan, the people responsible for organizing the ""White Lives Matter"" banner are ""missing the point"" of the Black Lives Matter movement.

He makes the point that although Burnley ""has come so far"" after the race riots in 2001, a small minority do not realize that the Black Live Matter movement is ""not about a phrase.""

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero (left) and Burnley defender James Tarkowski take a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

""It's a movement, an understanding, a realization that over the history that Black people have faced and still continue to face challenges of racism, as we saw through the tragic death of George Floyd,"" Khan, who admitted he was ""very disappointed and embarrassed"" when he was told of the banner, told CNN's Phil Black.

But not everyone is feeling embarrassment. When CNN traveled to Burnley on Tuesday, one woman interviewed by CNN outside the club's Turf Moor Stadium was trying to stick sheets of paper with the message ""White Lives Matter Too"" to the outside of the ground. The club's social media pages have also been flooded with criticism to the club's response.

""This is a moment to seize the opportunity to look at and reflect on all the institutions across the globe,"" noted Khan, who added that too many are seeing Black Lives Matter as just a phrase.

""And that is their ignorance,"" he said. ""And I think they are missing the point. And it's about time they need to be educated. Just like we've been educating people around homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. We've got to look at all the injustices of society and stand up to them and deal with them.""

Following a police investigation, Chief Superintendent Russ Procter said that ""there are no criminal offenses that have been disclosed at this time.""

Burnley's English defender Ben Mee said he was ""ashamed and embarrassed that a small number of our fans have decided to fly that around the stadium.""

'Unacceptable'

In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Burnley CEO Neil Hart said that the motivation behind the banner was to ""incite racial hatred.""

""Clearly all lives matter: White, Black, wherever you're from. What we are saying, through the campaign, are Black and ethnic minority groups have faced persecution and injustice and inequality for hundreds of years and are still facing that today and that is the reason behind this campaign,"" said Hart. ""We are not saying White lives don't matter.

""We are standing very firm against any kind of discriminatory behavior. And that's what last night was about. Last night was driven by a group of individuals who are linked to a far-right group and last night's motivation was to incite racial hatred, full stop. And that is unacceptable.""

Burnley CEO Neil Hart said that the individuals involved with the banner ""are known to the club.""

Burnley has had a close relationship with far-right politics. In 2009, the British National Party won its first seat on an English county council with a victory in Lancashire in the Padiham and Burnley West ward. Khan has fought both British far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson when he ""[stood in] the north west of England"" and former BNP leader Nicholas Griffin

Khan, who was ""born and bred"" in Burnley, says that he got into politics to fight against the far right in elections in the town and ""expose the ignorance and the politics of hatred and division.""

""[Racism in Burnley] is not different than anywhere else in any part of the country or the world,"" the 40-year-old Khan said. ""The people that did the banner, they had their way of thinking.

""But that way of thinking has been defeated consistently and persistently through people out there making a positive contribution. And I think the negative politics of division and hatred can only be defeated where enough good men and women come out and show the very best in what's great in the areas.

""And I think the way we've got to tackle this is by being more inclusive, by supporting movements that tackle discrimination and inequality, like the Premier League, the Black Lives Matter movement.""

Khan says that despite the Burnley's past, it has become a ""very cohesive community.""

Staying on track

Before the Whites Live Matter banner was flown over the Etihad Stadium, a lot of positive momentum appeared to have been garnered through the Premier League's support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

And former Liverpool and England striker Emile Heskey believes the banner was an attempt by ""one silly person"" who wanted to ""make it about themselves.""

""You're always going to get one person who spoils what's going on and this is a positive movement,"" Heskey told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies in an Instagram Live chat on Tuesday.

""It's a positive thing that people are sitting down and we're having discussions and we're openly discussing and acknowledging that, yes, we possibly do need changes. That, yes, we probably just skirted over a few things. Yes, let's see where we can actually help and make change.

Heskey is pictured playing for England against Italy.

""We're talking about a matter that, yes, people are acknowledging we need to do better and then you get one silly person making it about himself that he must fly a plane over a game. Why would you do such a thing?"""/['Phil Black', 'Jo Shelley', 'Amanda Davies', 'Ben Morse']/2020-06-24 00:00:00/"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200623121641-02-burnley-plane-banner-0622-super-tease.jpg"

It was not the result that Jurgen Klopp's men wanted on their return to action after a three-month hiatus, but with a 23-point lead over Manchester City, celebrations will not be long delayed.

Despite concerns over fans congregating near the stadium with Liverpool's Anfield less than a mile away, permission was given for the match to go ahead at Goodison. But in an empty stadium, the usually fevered atmosphere of the derby was lacking.

Also lacking was clear-cut chances for either side, with Liverpool, leaving a not fully fit Mo Salah on the bench, rarely troubling home goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/football/manchester-united-tottenham-rashford-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html"/Marcus Rashford takes a knee and raises his fist as Manchester United draw/"(CNN) There was to be no perfect ending to a momentous week for Marcus Rashford as Manchester United was held to a 1-1 draw against Tottenham Friday.

It was only three days ago that the 22-year-old became a national hero with his free school meal campaign that forced the UK government into a U-turn but the forward was unable to inspire his side to victory in its first game since the Premier League restart.

Bruno Fernandes' late penalty saved a point for United after Steven Bergwijn had given the hosts the lead.

There were powerful images before a ball was kicked at the rainsoaked Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with players observing a minute's applause for those who have died during the coronavirus pandemic.

Added poignancy was provided by the personalized shirts draped over seats of Tottenham season-ticket holders who had lost their lives over the last few months.

Players also took a knee before play commenced in support of the Black Lives Matter movement which has grown in prominence since the death of Geroge Floyd.

As well as taking a knee, Rashford raised his fist, in recognition of the symbol of black protest and liberation. Notably, Olympic medal winners John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the podium at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City during the US national anthem.

The gesture has been adopted many times since, and many have raised their fists during the Black Lives Matter protests in the aftermath of Floyd's death.

Individual names on the back of players' jerseys were also again replaced with the words 'Black Lives Matter.'

Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford takes a knee.

Players applaud commemorating the victims of the Covid-19.

Tottenham's new stadium usually boasts a cacophonous atmosphere, but with no fans allowed in Premier League games for the time being it seemed to take Jose Mourinho's side a while to get used to the empty stands.

United started on top as man-of-the-moment Rashford was denied the opening goal by the feet of Hugo Lloris.

It was then left to Bergwijn to open the scoring for Tottenham after a wonderful run from the 22-year-old, though United keeper David de Gea arguably was at fault for the goal.

Chances were few and far between in the second half as players still looked to be kicking off the rust after a long period away from the action.

It was the introduction of Paul Pogba from the substitute bench that gave United the boost it needed and the Frenchman's clever play resulted in his side being rewarded a penalty after Eric Dier's clumsy challenge.

Fernandes made no mistake from the penalty spot as he continues his impressive start to his Old Trafford career.

The visitors almost had the chance to clinch all three points but VAR rightly overturned another penalty that was awarded to United in the closing stages after Fernandes went down. Those were nervy moments for Dier given he was initially adjudged to have fouled Fernandes.

Referee Jonathan Moss takes the ball from Marcus Rashford after wrongly awarding a penalty.

Eyes on Rashford

All eyes had been on Rashford before the game after quite a week for the talented forward.

Very few have used their platform with such success, utilizing his extra spare time to focus on trying to help in his community.

His campaign on school meals saw him dominate the news agenda and ensure some of the poorest families in England would get extra support over the summer holidays.

The Manchester-born star has also raised millions in donations alongside food charity FareShare, launched a poetry competition for deaf children and learned sign language.

It's work that's caught the eye of Rashford's club boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who praised the talented youngster ahead of Friday's match.

""As his manager it's been fantastic to follow Marcus during the lockdown period,"" he told a virtual news conference Thursday.

""It's not just that he got the prime minister to change his mind but also what he's done over the last few months.

""He's changed the lives of so many kids this summer, which is more important than any game of football he'll probably have ever played, so hopefully he can keep both sides going as well as he's doing now.""

However, the forward failed to make a real impact in the match as United only really got going in the second half.

There was a moment in the second half when Pogba's raking pass brilliantly picked out Rashford, but the United forward was unable to capitalize on the chance.

In Friday's early game, Southampton brushed aside Norwich 3-0 at Carrow Road to leave the Canaries on the brink of relegation back into the second division.

After a shaky start, Saints dominated much of the action and took advantage of some lackluster defending from its hosts.

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/26/coronavirus-live-updates-us/"/Live updates: Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Nevada hit new highs in daily coronavirus cases/"LONDON — Holiday-loving Britons have reason to cheer: The British government said it would ease blanket travel restrictions early next month.

Earlier in June, Britain introduced new quarantine rules that meant almost anyone entering the country, including British nationals, would have to self-isolate for two weeks. For many Brits, this made the idea of jet-setting to Spain or France for their annual summer holiday seem almost impossible. But the British government said that, from July 6, it will scrap the quarantine rules for several European countries.

The news was splashed across the front pages of Saturday newspapers: “Fly out for sun, sea and 70% off,” said the Daily Mail. “Holiday season back on,” ran a headline on the front of the Times of London.

Brits love to holiday abroad: In normal times, about 60 percent of Brits go on an overseas holiday. Of course, these are not normal times, and it remains to be seen how many people will book a vacation to sun-kissed destinations. But the hard-hit travel industry was clearly elated with the news.

“It’s incredibly welcome,” said Jonathan Smith, a spokesman for ABTA, a trade association for travel agents and tour operators. He told the BBC that they expect a “surge of bookings … although some people may be slightly reticent to travel.”

Under a “traffic light system,” countries will be given a green, amber or red rating based on coronavirus levels and other measures. Passengers coming from countries with a “red” rating will have to continue to abide by the mandatory 14-day quarantine rules.

The full list of countries will be published next week. Top tourist destinations like France, Spain and Greece are expected to be on the approved list.

There was no suggestion that the United States would be on the approved list, although its exclusion could “potentially present a tricky diplomatic dynamic,” wrote the BBC’s Tom Burridge."/['Derek Hawkins', 'National', 'Breaking News Reporter', 'Karla Adam', 'London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom', 'Meryl Kornfield', 'Miriam Berger', 'Reporter Covering Middle East', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Brittany Shammas']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/06-26-2020/t_76a556ce96cb4aaca8be3d51fdfb74a5_name_20200626_pooltesting_pkg_thumb.jpg&w=1440"

The president has tapped into Pentagon accounts for the remaining $10 billion, including the $2.5 billion transfer last year that the 9th Circuit said Friday was unlawful.

Some of those funds already have been awarded as contracts to the private builders hired to construct the barrier. In its ruling, the court said the White House “lacked independent constitutional authority to authorize the transfer of funds” from the military.

AD

AD

“The panel noted that the Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress,” the decision said. “The ­panel held that the transfer of funds violated the Appropriations Clause, and, therefore, was unlawful.”

In response to a request for comment, the Department of Homeland Security sent a one-sentence statement from spokesman Alexei Woltornist. “We are sorely disappointed in this decision,” he said, without responding to questions about potential effects on construction currently underway.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal Friday’s ruling to the Supreme Court, which last year sided with the White House and lifted a 9th Circuit injunction freezing transfers of funds from military accounts. The Sierra Club and a collection of border activists sued the administration again last year when Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper tapped new funding streams for a fresh $2.5 billion.

Private contractors have completed about 220 miles of new fencing along the Mexico border, and DHS officials say they remain on track to deliver on Trump’s pledge to finish 450 miles by the end of 2020.

Construction has proceeded most swiftly on land already under government control, including wildlife preserves, national forests and other protected areas, outraging environmental groups, tribal authorities and others who view the 30-foot-tall steel structure as wasteful and destructive.

Gloria Smith, a Sierra Club attorney, called the ruling Friday “monumental” and said the court had “put a stop to Trump’s unconstitutional wall construction.”

“We should be protecting communities, our democracy, and the environment, not tearing these things apart as Trump hoped to do,” Smith said in a statement.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D), who has filed multiple challenges to the administration’s construction plans, also hailed the decision in a statement Friday. “While the Trump administration steals public funds to build an unauthorized wall at the southern border, families across the country are struggling to pay their bills,” he said. “They deserve to know that their hard-earned dollars are going where Congress intended — to benefit them and their communities.”

The Supreme Court last year lifted the lower-court injunction without ruling on the legality of the administration’s Pentagon transfers. But the administration has insisted the White House has the legal authority to pay for physical barriers as part of a wider effort to protect and defend the country’s borders. The Trump administration also has argued in recent months that security at the southern border is a crucial element of preventing further influx of the coronavirus, though the outbreak within the United States is by far the worst in the world.

AD

AD

The high court’s conservative majority ruled that the government had “made a sufficient showing at this stage” that private entities could not challenge the transfer of money by the executive branch.

But the 9th Circuit panel in San Francisco said “it is for the courts to enforce Congress’s priorities” and found that the Sierra Club “may invoke separation-of-

powers constraints, like the Appropriations Clause, to challenge agency spending in excess of its delegated authority.”

The showdown between Trump and Democratic lawmakers over border wall funding led to a 35-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. It ended in January 2019 when the president dropped his funding demand for $5 billion, reaching into military accounts instead.

Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert said in a Thursday news conference that he supported Martel’s firing and wants to alert the public that the law applies to everyone, including those sworn to uphold it.

“The standards that our community require aren’t subject to interpretation,” he said. “If [police] violate those professional standards, then we will terminate them. If their conduct rises to the level where it’s criminal, [State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle] is going to prosecute you.”

An affidavit for Martel’s arrest states Satchell and her friend Raheam “Remy” Staats-Flemming left the nightspot after being dissatisfied with the service and were refunded money for food.

AD

Satchell threw tip money at a waitress on her way out, prompting the club’s manager to notify security that he wanted uniformed Miami Gardens police officers who were working off-duty security to issue trespass warnings to Satchell and Staats-Flemming that would prevent them from returning for another visit, according to court records.

AD

As Satchell and her friend were about to leave the club’s parking lot, a security person stood in front of their black Mercedes SUV and Martel walked up to the driver side to speak with Satchell through her rolled-down window, according to the affidavit.

The records state Martel told Satchell that he needed her information because she was being given a trespass warning, despite her attempt to leave. He had no legal grounds to detain her, court records state.

AD

When Martel instructed Satchell to walk to his police car, records state, she requested to drive over because she wasn’t wearing shoes.

Less than 30 seconds after his first command for Satchell to walk over to his patrol car, Martel’s tone of voice grew agitated, according to court documents.

“Either you come out with me and do the trespass, or you are getting arrested,” Martel said, stating that Satchell would be cuffed for “resisting without violence,” according to the affidavit.

AD

Records state that Satchell asked her friend to record what was happening and told Martel that her father was also a police officer, to which he replied: “Okay. I don’t care about that.”

AD

The two then engaged in a struggle that involved Martel reaching into the vehicle and trying to pull Satchell out while she tried to stop him from doing so, court records show.

Once he pulled her out of the vehicle, Martel, who is 5-foot-9 and 190 pounds, used a leg sweep to force Satchell to the ground, according to the affidavit.

He knelt on the 5-3, 117-pound woman’s neck and used a stun gun twice in her abdomen area even though he had control of her left arm and another officer had control of her right, the affidavit states.

Satchell was transported to Miami’s Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center that night.

AD

Investigators found that Martel’s retelling of the encounter in an arrest affidavit for Satchell and an incident report had inaccuracies about what happened. Body-camera footage and Staats-Flemming’s cellphone footage, which captured a significant portion of the event, contradicts claims he made in official documents, according to court records.

AD

After reviews of footage and audio, Martel is accused of not mentioning arrest as often as he said he did in the reports, being the aggressor in the interaction and lying about Satchell fighting him and the other officer, according to the affidavit.

Satchell incurred abrasions on her stomach from the stun gun and other bruising on her arms and legs as a result of the arrest, resulting in Martel being accused of using “excessive force,” according to the affidavit.

AD

The local police union told CBS Miami that Martel’s charges seem to be a reaction to nationwide events surrounding law enforcement. Martel’s attorney, Douglas Hartman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment but told the Miami Herald he thought the charges were a “political move.”

AD

Jonathan Jordan, Satchell’s attorney, told the station in a statement that officers should be mindful of their actions.

“If you’re an officer that has broken policy or acted under color of law with a belief that black lives don’t matter, you ought to be looking over your shoulder, because the chickens have finally come home to roost,” he said.

“By changing our flag, we don’t abandon our founding principles,” he said. “We embrace them more fully by doing what is right. We’re not moving further away from our founding fathers’ visions. We’re moving closer to them. We’re not destroying our heritage; we’re fulfilling it.”

AD

AD

Earlier in the day, Gov. Tate Reeves (R), who had long insisted voters alone should decide whether to abandon the state’s flag, said for the first time Saturday that he would sign a bill on the issue if one is sent his way.

“The legislature has been deadlocked for days as it considers a new state flag,” he wrote in a Facebook post. “The argument over the 1894 flag has become as divisive as the flag itself and it’s time to end it. If they send me a bill this weekend, I will sign it.”

A debate has raged this week over the state flag, the last in the country to feature the Confederate battle flag in its design. The symbol, with 13 white stars atop a blue X with a red background, appears in the Mississippi flag’s upper-left corner.

AD

Adopted more than 30 years after the end of the Civil War, the banner has continued to fly despite years of criticism over its symbology, including previous attempts to change it. In 2001, Mississippians voted 2-to-1 to keep the 1894 design.

AD

But amid a heightened focus on Confederate symbols across the nation, Mississippi legislators and institutions have in recent days come out against the flag. Among those now opposing the flag are multiple legislators from both parties, the Mississippi Historical Society, Walmart and the Mississippi Baptist Convention.

A state lawmaker told CNN Friday there now might be enough votes to remove it.

Reeves went from saying Wednesday that there was “an effort underway across the country to erase our nation’s history” and that a veto “would be pointless” to his Saturday statement that it was time “resolve that the page has been turned” and “find a way to come together.”

“We should not be under any illusion that a vote in the Capitol is the end of what must be done — the job before us is to bring the state together,” Reeves said in his Saturday statement, “and I intend to work night and day to do it.”"/['Brittany Shammas', 'General Assignment Reporter']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/06-27-2020/t_34fe4c64bbe741dfb3193d6c07c4e6d1_name_20200627_ms_leg_speech.jpg&w=1440"
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/27/emancipation-monument-in-washington-dc-targeted-by-protests/"/Frederick Douglass delivered a Lincoln reality check at Emancipation Memorial unveiling/"By all accounts, Douglass, the great orator and abolitionist, was not pleased with the monument, which depicted Lincoln holding a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation while towering over a kneeling black man who had broken his chains.

Douglass, who commanded audiences across the world with his dignified poise and intellect, extended polite platitudes in the speech about the beauty of the monument, which had been designed and sculpted by Thomas Ball and had been financed mostly by donations from formerly enslaved people.

AD

AD

Then Douglass, a tall man with a nearly white crown of hair, launched into a 32-minute rapid-fire discourse on the conflicted legacy of Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, as the country moved into the third year of the Civil War. Lincoln’s proclamation had declared “that all persons held as slaves” within the rebellious states “are, and henceforward shall be free.”

As great as the proclamation was, Douglass explained, Lincoln had issued the document of freedom reluctantly.

Lincoln’s motivation was to save the union. According to the Library of Congress, in response to a challenge in the New York Tribune by the journalist Horace Greeley that he take a clear stance on abolition, Lincoln had provided a response stating, “If I could save the union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.”

AD

AD

In his speech at the 1876 statue unveiling, Douglass exposed Lincoln’s legacy. “Truth compels me to admit, even here in the presence of the monument we have erected to his memory,” Douglass said, “Abraham Lincoln was not, in the fullest sense of the word, either our man or our model. In his interests, in his associations, in his habits of thought, and in his prejudices, he was a white man.”

Douglass, who had met Lincoln on several occasions at the White House, said that Lincoln was not a president for black people and that Lincoln’s motivation above all was to save the union, even if it meant keeping black people in bondage.

“He was preeminently the white man’s president, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men,” Douglass said, according to the speech stored at the Library of Congress. “He was ready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration to deny, postpone, and sacrifice the rights of humanity in the colored people to promote the welfare of the white people of this country.”

More than 144 years later, the controversy surrounding Lincoln’s legacy and the “Emancipation Monument” has erupted again. This week, protesters demanded the removal of the monument, which is also called the Freedmen’s Monument. Police built barriers around the monument to protect it after some protesters threatened to tear it down. On Thursday, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced that the city should debate the removal of the statue, and “not have a mob decide they want to pull it down.”

Historians say the threats offer an opportunity to explain Lincoln’s complicated legacy to general audiences that know only the simplistic view of Lincoln as the president who freed the slaves.

AD

AD

C.R. Gibbs, a historian and author of “Black, Copper & Bright: The District of Columbia’s Black Civil War Regiment,” explained that the kneeling slave depicted in the Emancipation Monument was most likely inspired by an old abolitionist image used to fight for freedom for enslaved black people. “It was probable that the white sculptor was influenced by the poster with the words, ‘Am I Not a Man and Brother’ over a kneeling slave,” Gibbs said.

At the time of the monument’s commissioning, Harriet Hosmer, who was considered one of the first female professional sculptors, designed an alternative sculpture that would have depicted several figures, including a black Union soldier.

“Some scholars and historians believe that would have been too revolutionary,” Gibbs said, “and perhaps too expensive. But it was an opportunity missed.”

AD

AD

Douglass used his speech at the unveiling, Gibbs said, ""to clean up and clarify exactly what Lincoln’s contributions were with respect to black people.”

“For black people, Lincoln was neither our man nor our model,” Gibbs said, echoing Douglass. In his speech, Gibbs said, Douglass told the crowd that Lincoln “was important in the struggle and we honor that. But Douglass wanted Lincoln to emerge from the myth.”

In August 1862, Lincoln told a group of black leaders during a visit to the White House that they were to blame for the Civil War. “He said, ‘But for your presence amongst us, there would be no war.’ ”

“Basically, he was saying, ‘you all are the cause of the war,’ ” Gibbs said. “Lincoln had said he was not an abolitionist. When we say Lincoln freed the slaves, we leave out the agency and sacrifice of U.S. colored troops and those in the Navy who fought and died for this freedom.”

According to the Library of Congress, “Lincoln honored Douglass with three invitations to the White House, including an invitation to Lincoln’s second inauguration. During his first visit, Douglass petitioned Lincoln to pay African American Union soldiers as much as their white counterparts. Lincoln answered that African American soldiers would get their fair wages when the time was right, which frustrated Douglass, although he came to understand Lincoln’s reasoning.”

In the speech at the unveiling of the monument, Douglass gives the audience an idea of how complicated his relationship with Lincoln was.

AD

AD

“The name of Abraham Lincoln was near and dear to our hearts in the darkest and most perilous hours of the republic,” Douglass said. “We were no more ashamed of him when shrouded in clouds of darkness, of doubt, and defeat than when we saw him crowned with victory, honor, and glory. Our faith in him was often taxed and strained to the uttermost, but it never failed.”

Douglass criticized Lincoln as not moving fast enough to free thousands of enslaved black people:

When he tarried long in the mountain; when he strangely told us that we were the cause of the war; when he still more strangely told us that we were to leave the land in which we were born; when he refused to employ our arms in defense of the Union; when, after accepting our services as colored soldiers, he refused to retaliate our murder and torture as colored prisoners; when he told us he would save the Union if he could with slavery; when he revoked the Proclamation of Emancipation of General Fremont; when he refused to remove the popular commander of the Army of the Potomac, in the days of its inaction and defeat, who was more zealous in his efforts to protect slavery than to suppress rebellion; when we saw all this, and more, we were at times grieved, stunned, and greatly bewildered; but our hearts believed while they ached and bled.

Douglass also said that Lincoln’s slow pace was frustrating and bewildering. In short, Douglass said, Lincoln tried the patience of abolitionists who wanted a speedy end to slavery:

“Despite the mist and haze that surrounded him; despite the tumult, the hurry, and confusion of the hour, we were able to take a comprehensive view of Abraham Lincoln, and to make reasonable allowance for the circumstances of his position,” Douglass said. “We saw him, measured him, and estimated him; not by stray utterances to injudicious and tedious delegations, who often tried his patience; not by isolated facts torn from their connection; not by any partial and imperfect glimpses, caught at inopportune moments; but by a broad survey, in the light of the stern logic of great events, and in view of that divinity which shapes our ends, rough hew them how we will, we came to the conclusion that the hour and the man of our redemption had somehow met in the person of Abraham Lincoln.”

Douglass said abolitionists cared little about how Lincoln proclaimed emancipation.

AD

“It was enough for us that Abraham Lincoln was at the head of a great movement, and was in living and earnest sympathy with that movement, which, in the nature of things, must go on until slavery should be utterly and forever abolished in the United States.”

AD

In the speech, Douglass concluded that despite Lincoln’s failings, he should be remembered for the great accomplishment of freeing thousands of enslaved people.

“Though he loved Caesar less than Rome, though the union was more to him than our freedom or our future,” Douglass said, “under his wise and beneficent rule we saw ourselves gradually lifted from the depths of slavery to the heights of liberty and manhood.”

AD

Then Douglass recalled the scenes of black people waiting for the emancipation to take effect.

“Can any colored man, or any white man friendly to the freedom of all men, ever forget the night which followed the first day of January, 1863, when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln would prove to be as good as his word?” Douglass asked. “I shall never forget that memorable night, when in a distant city I waited and watched at a public meeting, with three thousand others not less anxious than myself, for the word of deliverance which we have heard read today. Nor shall I ever forget the outburst of joy and thanksgiving that rent the air when the lightning brought to us the emancipation proclamation.”

AD

Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever endemic in animal populations that reside in Africa’s tropical forests and is passed from person to person through contact with bodily fluids. Congo has had 11 outbreaks since the virus was first identified in humans in 1976. A new outbreak began on June 1 in the country’s northwest and has resulted in 15 deaths as of Thursday. The worst outbreak of the virus swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014 and 2016, killing more than 11,000.

North Kivu and Ituri proved to be an exceptionally challenging theater for the contact tracing and community outreach required during an Ebola outbreak. Armed groups have killed hundreds of locals in numerous regional conflicts since the outbreak began, and health workers often came under fire while doing their work.

AD

Front-line nurses were routinely evacuated from particularly volatile areas, leaving the response on pause and the virus more free to spread. One deadly stretch late last November saw four people involved in the response killed in attacks by unknown assailants. Overall 11 were killed and 86 injured, according to the WHO.

AD

The broader humanitarian situation has worsened as well. The number of people in need of aid in the two Ebola-affected provinces has grown more than 250 percent since the start of the outbreak, from 1.2 to 4.3 million people, according to the International Rescue Committee, which has worked closely with the Ebola response. Eastern Congo has not seen a large number of coronavirus cases, but Congo at large has not escaped the new pandemic.

“Initial research indicates that covid-19, which continues to spread with nearly 6,000 cases [across the country], could compound these devastating consequences for the most vulnerable populations,” said Borry Jatta, the organization’s Ebola response director.

Eteni Longondo, Congo’s health minister, said in a news conference on Thursday that tackling the coronavirus would require “the same strategy in the struggle, the same methodology in the struggle” against Ebola.

Despite the hurdles, a well-financed global response was able to make use of several experimental vaccines and treatments, which were credited with helping slow the virus’s spread while a cure remains elusive. Different strains of the virus exist, and different outbreaks have had mortality rates ranging from 25 to 90 percent.

AD

AD

More than 300,000 people were vaccinated with Ervebo, a vaccine made by the American pharmaceutical giant Merck, which became the world’s first fully licensed Ebola vaccine late last year.

A second vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, also an American company, was used as part of a clinical trial. Another clinical trial tested four experimental treatments, and two were found to improve survival.

While the response succeeded in containing the virus to two Congolese provinces, it was regularly criticized by locals for being involved in the region’s rampant corruption as well as paying unpopular security forces for protection, evidence of which was uncovered by journalists. The WHO, which led the response, has refused to comment on how much money it paid to the United Nations’ peacekeeping force, the Congolese army or other local armed groups.

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/06/25/nascar-investigation-cant-determine-who-tied-noose-talladega-garage-stall/"/NASCAR releases noose photo and defends process but can’t determine who tied it/"NASCAR President Steve Phelps shared those findings Thursday in a conference call announcing that the sport had concluded its internal investigation of the incident that the FBI determined was not a hate crime but that nonetheless thrust stock-car racing into an ugly national spotlight and roiled its fan base.

AD

Moments before Phelps spoke to reporters about NASCAR’s findings and the steps it will take going forward, NASCAR released a photograph of the noose taken by its security staff during the investigation.

AD

“As you can see from the photo, the noose was real, as was our concern for Bubba,” Phelps said.

Phelps vigorously defended the urgency of NASCAR’s response and said he would do the same again, adding that in hindsight he should have used the word “alleged” in his initial statement condemning what he referred to as a “heinous act” hours after the discovery of the noose was reported by a member of Wallace’s race team Sunday afternoon.

“Upon learning of and seeing the noose, our initial reaction was to protect our driver,” Phelps said. “We’re living in a highly charged and emotional time. What we saw was a symbol of hate [that] was only present in one area of the garage: that of the 43 car of Bubba Wallace.

AD

“… Based on the evidence we had, we felt that one of our drivers had been threatened — a driver who had been extremely courageous in his recent words and deeds.”

AD

Phelps’s remarks came two days after the FBI closed its investigation without bringing federal charges after determining that the noose had been in that particular stall since at least October, when NASCAR last raced at Talladega. As a result, the FBI concluded, it could not have been intended as a symbol directed at Wallace because no one could have known Wallace would have been assigned that stall. In other words, the FBI concluded it was an extreme coincidence.

Nonetheless, NASCAR continued with its own probe, alarmed by why a noose was found in one of its garage stalls in the first place. Among the governing body’s questions: How did the noose get there? Was anyone an intended target? Was this a code-of-conduct violation? Are nooses present elsewhere in other garages where NASCAR races?

AD

NASCAR’s investigation concluded the noose was “created at some point” during its October 2019 race weekend based on photographic and video evidence that showed it wasn’t dangling by the garage door at the weekend’s start but was at the end of the weekend.

AD

Wallace’s team ended up in that stall Sunday — one of 44 in Talladega’s garage — under a NASCAR policy that assigns stalls according to teams’ standings in the season-long points race. Under the sport’s novel coronavirus protocol, that policy has been tweaked to place multicar race teams side by side, which shuffled Wallace’s team, then 20th in the standings, further back in the garage than it normally would have been.

At the October 2019 race, the stall was assigned to Wood Brothers, NASCAR’s oldest continuously operating Cup team, founded in Stuart, Va., in 1950. Members of the Wood Brothers team, which fields the No. 21 Ford driven by Matt DiBenedetto, were interviewed by the FBI, Phelps said, along with race team personnel from multiple teams, NASCAR officials, track fire and safety personnel and track custodial staff.

AD

“Given that timing and the garage access policies and procedures at the time [before coronavirus protocols limited garage access], we were unfortunately unable to determine with any certainty who tied this rope in this manner or why it was done,” Phelps said.

NASCAR’s closure of the incident probably won’t quell the racial tensions that have ratcheted up daily since Phelps announced June 10 that the sport was banning displays of the Confederate flag at its racetracks to send a message that all fans are welcome at its events.

AD

On Thursday, Phelps made clear that NASCAR would not retreat from that policy despite virulent pushback from a segment of its fan base that views the flag as the symbol of a fierce, proud heritage.

AD

“We are not going to back off of that policy,” Phelps said. “We have made the statement, and we’re going to follow through to its fullest.”

Much of the venom of irate fans has been directed at Wallace, 26, an Alabama native who had called on NASCAR to ban displays of the flag to send a message of inclusion. That advocacy had made him a target entering NASCAR’s June 21 race at Talladega, the first event at which its flag ban would be enforced as the sport gradually emerges from quarantine, admitting 5,000 spectators that day.

From the moment NASCAR announced the discovery of the noose Sunday night, a vocal group of conspiracists accused Wallace of staging the scene — even though neither he nor any of the 39 other Cup Series drivers had access to Talladega’s garage under the sport’s coronavirus protocols.

AD

AD

Phelps acknowledged he was troubled and bewildered by the unfounded, vitriol-laced allegations that erupted on social media. “I just find it incredibly disturbing that there are those that are out there that just feel the need to spread the hate or to spread false things,” he said. “I just — I don’t understand it. I really don’t.”

Others slammed NASCAR, the FBI and journalists for using the term “noose” to describe what they insisted, sight unseen, was an ordinary pull rope that is commonly used to shut garage doors or lower attic stairs.

The photograph released by NASCAR makes clear, however, that the rope found in Talladega’s No. 4 stall was fashioned into a noose with deliberation.

AD

Phelps would not speculate on the intent behind it.

“We have no idea what the intent was at all, whether there was any malice in it or whether it was just fashioned as a noose for a pulley,” he said. “We don't know that.”

AD

He also noted that many garage members must have passed by the noose, whether this past fall or Sunday, without noticing or commenting, which has convinced him to mandate that all NASCAR members undergo sensitivity and unconscious-bias training.

“Our ultimate conclusion for this investigation is to ensure that this never happens again, that no one walks by a noose without recognizing the potential damage it can do,” Phelps said.

AD

In closing, he offered a final thought about Wallace.

“Bubba has done nothing but represent this sport with courage, class and dignity, and he stood tall for what he believes in,” Phelps said. “And we all need to stand with him. I know I’m going to.”

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/06/26/nba-forges-ahead-plans-disney-restart/?itid=sf_sports"/NBA forges ahead with plans for Disney restart: ‘No options are risk-free’/"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league and the players’ union share the belief that their “deliberate, intentional and collaborative” plan will provide a safe environment even though Florida reported nearly 9,000 new cases Friday.

AD

AD

“We are left with no choice but to learn to live with this virus,” Silver said on a conference call with reporters, his first since April. “No options are risk-free right now. And if we can’t sit on the sidelines indefinitely, we must adapt. My ultimate conclusion is that we can’t outrun the virus. While [the bubble] is not impermeable, we are in essence protected from cases around us. For those reasons, we’re still very comfortable being in Orlando.”

More than 300 players reported to teams in their home markets this week for testing as the league entered Phase 2 of its return plan. Sixteen players tested positive and will be subject to self-quarantine in the coming days, although Silver noted that none of the players “were seriously ill in any way” and that the number was “roughly where we expected,” given age and demographic trends.

Players who tested positive will undergo subsequent tests and a cardiac screening before they will be cleared to travel to Florida. A few players, including Washington Wizards forward Davis Bertans and Los Angeles Lakers guard Avery Bradley, have announced they will not play.

AD

AD

“I’m somewhat relieved that the number [of positive tests] wasn’t higher,” said NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts, who joined Silver on the conference call. “I was also relieved that we had the foresight to identify the players that would be testing positive now. The great majority of our players have been doing exactly what they should be doing. One [positive test] is too many, but 150 would have been devastating.”

The NBA’s bubble plan, laid out in a 113-page health and safety protocol, drew praise from public health experts, including Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, because it reflected many best practices in mitigating the spread of the virus. Games will be held on a single-site campus without fans. Players must undergo daily testing, and wear masks and maintain social distancing when they are not playing. A positive test within the bubble will be met with a strict quarantine procedure and contact tracing efforts; play will continue without the affected player, who will be treated as if he was injured.

Even so, as Florida’s coronavirus cases skyrocketed this week, doubts about the plan mounted in part because some Disney employees will be allowed to leave the bubble to return home after work and in part because numerous other teams in Florida have had to suspend training camps and practices after positive tests. After keeping its daily new caseload under 2,000 throughout April and May, Florida surpassed 3,000 new cases June 18, exceeded 5,000 on Wednesday and nearly hit 9,000 on Friday. Orange County, home to Disney World, also has had its case numbers and positivity rate dramatically increase.

“I probably wouldn’t have played because the unknown going into that situation looks crazy right now, seeing so many new cases,” Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant told the DawgTalk podcast this week. “It’s just so unpredictable. It’s easy for me to say right now because I’m injured [so I can’t play anyway]. I probably would have chilled [at home].”

AD

AD

Silver acknowledged the league’s internal concern “has increased” this week and said the league and players are “closely monitoring” developments, but he expressed confidence in the bubble concept. A “subset” of Disney employees could be subjected to additional testing, he added, as a method to ensure the health of personnel inside the bubble.

“We ultimately believe it will be safer on our campus than outside it,” Silver said, leaving open the possibility that a “significant spread” of the coronavirus inside the bubble “might lead us to stop” the resumed season. “We’re not saying full steam ahead no matter what happens.”

The NBA has not set a threshold for when to pull the plug if faced with a widespread outbreak. The players, cognizant of the bubble’s inherent uncertainties, opted to proceed anyway. Roberts said she can “sleep at night” knowing the level of detail that was put into the health and safety plan, which includes extensive security to maintain the perimeter of the bubble and efforts to manage players’ mental health.

Still, the idea of living and working within the bubble for up to three months without the ability to freely come and go is daunting.

“We never pictured ourselves playing like this,” said Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul, the NBPA’s president. “When people hear health and safety, a lot of times people think about injury or they just think about covid-19. While both are important, I think mental health is the biggest thing that a lot of us players think of first.”

The finalized restart agreement followed ongoing conversations about social justice protests that included Silver, Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum, Roberts, Paul and other members of the NBPA.

Numerous players, including Nets guard Kyrie Irving, have argued that resuming basketball could take attention away from efforts to reform police departments or expand voting rights. In a joint statement, the NBA and NBPA said Wednesday that “the goal of the season restart in Orlando will be to take collective action to combat systemic racism and promote social justice.”

The players have engaged the league on increasing the number of black executives and coaches, adding partnerships between the league and black-owned businesses and launching a foundation to support efforts in the black community. While Paul didn’t disclose specific plans for player demonstrations during time spent in the bubble, he added that they have no intention of participating in “a shut-up-and-dribble situation.”

“We have a great group of players who are well-informed … about covid-19 and social injustices,” said Andre Iguodala, a Miami Heat forward and the NBPA’s vice president. “Everyone is making some type of sacrifice. A lot of people in America don’t have jobs right now. [By playing,] we have the opportunity to be a beacon of light and show our sympathies.”

Before the NBA proceeds to its standard 16-team postseason format, each team will play eight regular season games in a “seeding” round that will set the playoff bracket and allow players to shake off rust. The results and statistics for these games will count toward regular season totals, and the matchups were determined by the remaining opponents on each team’s schedule before the shutdown, with a balancing process used to finalize pairings.

Games begin July 30 with a TNT doubleheader that features the New Orleans Pelicans versus the Utah Jazz and a crosstown battle between the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers. July 31 will see five games, highlighted by an ESPN doubleheader featuring the Boston Celtics versus the Milwaukee Bucks and the Houston Rockets versus the Dallas Mavericks. This TV-friendly launch ensures that the league’s brightest stars set to compete in Orlando — LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and James Harden — all appear on the first two nights.

Teams will then play between four and seven games per night through Aug. 14, with at least three of those games nationally televised on TNT, ESPN or NBA TV. From there, the schedule will proceed to a possible play-in round for the eighth seeds in each conference before the first round of the playoffs starts on Aug. 17.

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/25/saturday-night-live-blackface/"/SNL is proof that blackface has long been an issue in comedy/"“What if the blackface was just part of your costume of a black person?” one lawmaker asked. “Does it count if you did it all the way back in the ’80s?” another wondered. Blackface “was never funny or cool,” chided Thompson’s character, who ultimately concluded that his colleagues were beyond help.

The sketch would have been just as timely a few months before when Megyn Kelly parted ways with NBC after questioning why it would be considered racist to wear blackface as part of a Halloween costume. Or a few months later when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for resurfaced photos and videos of him in blackface. And that, of course, was part of the point. But as the New York Daily News and other outlets later pointed out, “Saturday Night Live” has its own history with blackface — a history that spans most of the show’s 45-year existence.

AD

SNL’s not-so-distant history with blackface garnered renewed attention earlier this month after social media users called out “Tonight Show” host and SNL alum Jimmy Fallon for wearing blackface during a 2000 sketch. SNL, of course, isn’t the only TV comedy to use blackface: Fallon’s ABC counterpart Jimmy Kimmel apologized this week for doing the same while impersonating NBA player Karl Malone on Comedy Central’s “The Man Show” in the early aughts, and several years-old episodes from shows including “30 Rock” and “W/ Bob & David” were pulled from streaming services because they feature blackface. But as a long-standing institution of American comedy, SNL provides a window into a culture that has continued to passively embrace an inherently racist tradition meant to demean and mock black people.

Blackface as entertainment emerged from 19th-century minstrel shows that featured white actors in dark makeup, playing characters who embodied stereotypical depictions of African Americans. It continued well into the 20th century with white performers, including legendary child star Shirley Temple, donning blackface in highly visible roles. Some actors, such as Al Jolson, rose to fame in blackface, which also seeped into children’s cartoons before largely — but not completely — falling out of public favor after the civil rights movement.

SNL, which debuted in 1975, featured white performers in blackface long after that. Billy Crystal wore blackface while impersonating Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1980s, even while acting opposite civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who hosted the show in 1984. National moments of reckoning — such as Ted Danson’s widely ridiculed appearance in blackface at the 1993 roast for his then-girlfriend, Whoopi Goldberg — also did little to deter the show. More than a decade after Jackson’s hosting gig, Darrell Hammond, who was on SNL from 1995 to 2009, darkened his skin to play Jackson on a recurring basis.

AD

Fallon came under fire in late May after clips from the sketch show in which he is wearing blackface while impersonating former SNL cast member Chris Rock recirculated online. “I am very sorry for making this unquestionably offensive decision and thank all of you for holding me accountable,” Fallon tweeted. He later apologized on his late-night show, where he discussed the incident with CNN’s Don Lemon, anti-racism educator Jane Elliott and NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who praised Fallon’s “powerful” monologue.

Rock famously left SNL after an early-’90s stint, during a portion of which he was the show’s only black comedian. He landed at “In Living Color,” the far more diverse sketch comedy series created by Keenen Ivory Wayans. “I wanted to be in an environment where I didn’t have to really translate the comedy that I wanted to do,” Rock told Marc Maron in a 2011 interview.

Even when SNL has employed racial stereotypes in an attempt to offer subversive commentary, past efforts often fell flat because of the show’s lack of diversity on- and off-screen. When Oprah Winfrey hosted in 1986, the cold open centered on her pointed refusal to dress up as Aunt Jemima. But the same sketch featured Danitra Vance, then the only black comedian on the show, serving coffee to executive producer Lorne Michaels, whom she called “Mr. Lorne,” while dressed like Celie, Goldberg’s character from “The Color Purple.” Michaels asks Vance what he should do to get Winfrey to play Aunt Jemima. “Beat her,” Vance replies. (In the end, it’s Winfrey who doles out a faux beating.)

AD

In an ironic twist nearly 30 years later, SNL was urged to hire a black female comedian after Thompson told TV Guide in a 2013 interview that he would no longer dress up as a woman to play prominent black women, including Winfrey. A few weeks later, the show — which hadn’t featured a black woman in its cast since Maya Rudolph’s departure in 2007 — controversially featured host Kerry Washington as Michelle Obama, with cast members poking fun at how they hadn’t seen the first lady in “years.”

But even after a concerted effort — following an onslaught of criticism — to add black cast members and writers among its ranks in recent years, the show has yet to publicly grapple with its long history of blackface. The result is an uneven legacy that juxtaposes the show’s occasionally sharp racial humor (ranging from the groundbreaking “Racist Word Association Interview” sketch starring Richard Pryor to last year’s masterful “Mid-Day News”) with recurring missteps around representation and sketches that perpetuate racial stereotypes instead of subverting them. At worst, the show undermines the brilliance of sketches such as “Black Jeopardy,” which is elevated by the insight of SNL’s black staffers, including Thompson, now the show’s longest-running cast member, and Michael Che, the first black comedian to be named a head writer on the show.

Michaels, who also produced “30 Rock,” defended his show’s use of blackface as recently as 2008, when Fred Armisen, who is not black, donned conspicuously darker makeup to impersonate President Barack Obama. Michaels told The Washington Post’s Paul Farhi that the show had auditioned several black comedians — including Thompson, then the show’s lone black cast member — to play Obama but that Armisen had the “best take” on the nation’s first black president.

AD

“It’s not about race,” Michaels said. “It’s about getting a take on Obama, where it serves the comedy and the writing.” Armisen, who is of Venezuelan, Korean and German descent, dismissed the criticism, telling New York magazine, “There’s shading on my eyebrows and plastic behind my ears.” He added that he wore the same “honey color” he wore to portray another black entertainer: Prince.

Eventually, Jay Pharoah, who is black, took on the role of Obama after joining the show in 2010. But critiques endured when it came to how SNL used black cast members in sketches. After leaving the show in 2016, Pharoah recalled nearly losing his job after saying, in an interview with theGrio, that SNL needed to pay more attention to black female comedians. In the end, he told “Ebro in the Morning,” he felt underutilized and too often reduced to doing impersonations of famous black men.

“You go where you’re appreciated. You know what I mean?” said Pharoah, whose SNL contract wasn’t renewed for a seventh season. “And if you have multiple people on the cast saying things like ‘You’re so talented, and you’re able; they don’t use you, and it’s unfair and it’s making us feel bad because they don’t use you and you’re a talent …’ ”

The comedian also noted that the show had yet to name his successor in impersonating Obama in the final months of his presidency, a position it never ended up filling. “Honest to God, no disrespect to them, but I kind of feel like they gave up,” he said."/['Bethonie Butler', 'Reporter Covering Television', 'Pop Culture']/2020-06-25 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AELUIVDOTNC6NI6BEHTUDZ5TMY.JPG&w=1440"
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/25/dixie-chicks-change-name-chicks/"/Dixie Chicks drop Dixie, change name to The Chicks: ‘We want to meet this moment’/"The name change comes two weeks after Lady Antebellum, another country trio, announced that they would just be known as “Lady A,” and expressed regret and embarrassment at their previous name’s association with the pre-Civil War slavery era. Afterward, others wondered on social media whether the Dixie Chicks would take the same step, given the Dixie association with the Confederate South.

AD

In a statement, the Chicks also noted that they checked with a New Zealand duo also called the Chicks — a likely preemptive measure after Lady A saw backlash when they didn’t realize their new moniker was already used by a blues singer in Seattle. “A sincere and heartfelt thank you goes out to ‘The Chicks’ of NZ for their gracious gesture in allowing us to share their name,” the band said. “We are honored to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters. Chicks Rock!”

The Chicks also dropped a new music video for “March March,” which features people through history marching for civil rights as well as many recent videos from Black Lives Matter protests. (Including an image of “Black Lives Matter” painted in front of the White House.) The first scene shows a quote on screen: “If your voice held no power, they wouldn’t try to silence you.” That sentiment should come as no surprise, as the Chicks are known for speaking up: The band was essentially blacklisted from the country music industry after Maines criticized George W. Bush on the eve of the Iraq War in front of a London concert crowd.

However, the trio never backed down: Their first single after the incident was titled “Not Ready to Make Nice,” and called out the people who just told them to shut up and sing. (It wound up winning three Grammy Awards.) Earlier this year, the band confirmed plans for their first new album in 14 years titled “Gaslighter,” which shares a name with the fiery title track about an unrepentant liar. It was originally scheduled to drop in May, but amid the coronavirus pandemic, the release date was postponed until July 17.

At the time, coronavirus cases were rising sharply in Tulsa County, and Trump faced intense criticism for convening a large crowd for an indoor political rally, his first such event since the start of the pandemic.

As part of its safety plan, arena management had purchased 12,000 do-not-sit stickers for Trump’s rally, intended to keep people apart by leaving open seats between attendees. On the day of the rally, event staff had already affixed them on nearly every other seat in the arena when Trump’s campaign told event management to stop and then began removing the stickers, hours before the president’s arrival, according to a person familiar with the event who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

AD

In a video clip obtained by The Washington Post, two men — one in a suit and one wearing a badge and a face mask — can be seen pulling stickers off seats in a section of the arena. It is unclear who those two men are. When Trump took the stage on Saturday evening, the crowd was clustered together and attendees were not leaving empty seats between themselves.

The actions by Trump’s campaign were first reported Friday by Billboard Magazine. As rally preparations were underway, Trump’s campaign staff intervened with the venue manager, ASM Global, and told them to stop labeling seats in this way, Doug Thornton, executive vice president of ASM Global, told the magazine.

“They also told us that they didn’t want any signs posted saying we should social distance in the venue,” Thornton said. “The campaign went through and removed the stickers.”

AD

AD

A spokesman for ASM Global declined to comment.

Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh did not directly respond to questions about the sticker removal.

“The rally was in full compliance with local requirements. In addition, every rally attendee received a temperature check prior to admission, was given a face mask, and provided ample access to hand sanitizer,” Murtaugh said in an emailed statement.

In a separate statement, the campaign said: “There were signs posted and we are not aware of any campaign staff asking that they be removed.”

Trump held his Tulsa rally despite opposition by Oklahoma health authorities and residents who feared that convening a large crowd indoors could accelerate the spread of the coronavirus. The number of coronavirus cases in Tulsa County was spiking in the days leading up to the rally and has continued to increase since.

AD

The director of the Tulsa Health Department, Bruce Dart, had recommended that the event be postponed until it was safer. A number of city residents and business owners brought a lawsuit against the venue manager, ASM Global, seeking to require all attendees wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines from health authorities.

The Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected that suit.

On June 13, a week before the rally, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) wrote to the venue management saying he understood that Trump’s campaign “has presented plans to ASM Global in order to accommodate capacity crowds during a political rally.”

Stitt noted that Oklahoma was in “Phase 3” of its reopening plan and Trump’s rally “proceeding as planned is consistent with the guidance” of that plan. Stitt’s letter added that “we have also encouraged event licensees to refer to the general CDC guidelines for more information about COVID-19.”

AD

Two days before the rally, the managers of the BOK Center had asked the Trump campaign to provide a detailed written plan outlining the “health and safety” measures it intended to use to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Before the rally, Murtaugh said in an emailed statement: “We take safety seriously, which is why we're doing temperature checks for everyone attending, and providing masks and hand sanitizer. This will be a Trump rally, which means a big, boisterous, excited crowd. We don’t recall the media shaming demonstrators about social distancing — in fact the media were cheering them on.”

As the crowd entered the day of the rally, the Trump campaign handed out masks and small bottles of “Make America Great Again 2020” branded hand sanitizer.

AD

The BOK Center also put down floor decals in front of concession areas and put up plexiglass to protect vendors.

AD

At 1:47 p.m. that day, Fox 23 News posted on its Facebook page a photo from inside the BOK Center showing two members of the event staff putting stickers on seats. “Stickers are going on every other seat in the BOK Center saying ‘Do Not Sit Here’ to try to spread the crowd out for President Trump’s rally tonight,” the post read.

After the majority of the stickers were in place, a member of Trump’s campaign radioed staff in the event war room where arena management was monitoring preparations and told them to stop, according to the person familiar with the event. Event staff was told to continue applying the stickers. Later, the campaign began pulling them off, the person said.

AD

In video footage of Trump’s rally, there appeared to be no effort to keep an empty seat between attendees.

Attendance turned out to be less than Trump expected — he had said some 1 million people wanted tickets — and the arena was not full, particularly in the upper level.

AD

Trump had wanted every seat packed, and he told advisers coming in on Air Force One and at the arena he was displeased that the crowd was not larger, said two Trump advisers, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relay private conversations.

“He was quite angry,” said one person who interacted with him.

Trump had told North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) during a May 29 phone call that he would not hold a socially distanced convention in Charlotte because he had never had an empty seat since he came down the escalator at the start of his presidential campaign in 2015.

AD

Neither Trump nor the White House asked that the stickers be removed, said a senior White House official. While campaign staff and some attendees wore masks during the rally, many rallygoers did not.

At least six members of the Trump campaign advance staff have tested positive for the coronavirus, including two Secret Service employees. Dozens of Secret Service officers and agents who attended the Tulsa rally were ordered to self-quarantine.

Since the rally, coronavirus cases in Tulsa County hit a new high of 259 new confirmed cases on June 23."/['Joshua Partlow', 'National', 'Foreign Affairs.

“I turn 60 later this year so I noticed that acutely,” said Chip Conley, founder of the Modern Elder Academy, which he calls the world’s first midlife wisdom school. “It was all of a sudden: I’m in a high-risk group? I’m perceived as elderly?”

AD

I don’t mean to reject any help that might keep me and my graying cohort alive. Bring on those peaceful senior shopping hours. Nor would I ever argue that policing these linguistic limits should be a top priority when thousands of Americans have died, tens of millions are out of work and our democracy is floundering.

AD

All the same, this sudden downward pressure on the boundary of old age strikes me as un-American. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Census for years have used 65 to define older Americans. (It was only last Thursday that the CDC tried to calm the confusion with a news release stating: “It’s not just those over the age of 65 who are at increased risk for severe illness.”) You still can’t get Medicare until 65 or full Social Security benefits until age 66. So maybe this is something else we can blame on China and the World Health Organization, given that both use “over 60” to define old age, and both have been the source of a lot of coronavirus news.

More important, for those of us in the early-60s gray zone, the slipping standard harms more than our vanity, stealing our last shred of deniability even as the shutdown deprives us of tools we’ve relied on to pass ourselves off as younger, such as Botox, hair salons and gyms.

AD

Denial plays a vital role in human survival, which helps explain why most prefer to bask in it as long as possible.

“From age 40 onwards, people report feeling about 20 percent younger than their chronological age, an amount that obviously gets bigger over time,” Sarah Barber, an expert on cognitive aging at Georgia State University, told me. As we age, we also tend to imagine “old age” as beginning later and later, she said, further boosting our illusion that we’re still young.

AD

We’re only as old as we feel, as they say. The hitch is we can be made to feel older — and frailer and less competent — when reminded of our age and the inevitable downsides. This has been established by studies of the “stereotype threat,” meaning that when old people, or mothers, or other groups, for example, are reminded of the stereotypes about their group, they unwittingly tend to validate them.

AD

In one seminal study, older adults — in this case ages 62 to 84 — were split into three groups. One group read articles linking age to cognitive decline. Another read articles describing older people who stayed sharp as they aged. The third group did no reading. All three groups then took a test that challenged them to remember several words. Guess which group forgot most of them? The first one, of course.

Focusing on gloomy images of aging can make you less coordinated and even less healthy. Researchers have found that people who feel more negative about aging in midlife may later be less competent drivers and have a harder time recovering from a heart attack. People who accept the most depressing cultural images of aging may also take worse care of themselves, even shortening their own lives by an average of 7.5 years.

AD

Pandemic culture floods us with constant reminders about aging and death, not least with its nasty Twitter hashtags like BoomerDoomer and BoomerRemover. Stories about “seniors” are frequently illustrated with images of stooped postures and canes, or photos of lonely, white-haired grandmothers peering out of locked windows.

AD

No wonder my knees ache and I’ve recently switched to stronger reading glasses. More than once, I’ve asked my husband what day it is, which is unsettling for both of us, as much as I’ve heard other age groups are having the same trouble.

Seeking to stop stereotypes from becoming self-fulfilling prophecies, groups like Conley’s Modern Elder Academy and AARP have been trying to “reframe” aging, emphasizing the many purported benefits, such as wisdom and contentment. They’re casting a wide net, given that the average age of Conley’s “elders” is 52, and AARP starts mailing you membership cards when you turn 50.

AD

Ageism has long been one of America’s favorite prejudices, even though — if we’re lucky — we’ll all become its target. “We disparage elderly people without fear of censure,” wrote the psychologist authors of a study on aging stereotypes, “Doddering but dear.” Among other discouraging news, they cite research demonstrating that on top of discrimination in hiring and medical decisions, older adults are more likely than any other age group to appear on TV and in movies “as conduits for comic relief, exploiting stereotypes of physical, cognitive, and sexual ineffectiveness.”

AD

No wonder even many in the over-65 set don’t feel ready for the new considerations and limitations based on being officially over the hill.

“I feel grounded like a wayward adolescent punished for underage smoking or drinking,” complained Politico editor Paul Taylor, 65, referring to his cohort of “fit, never-been-busier, un-retirees” as “the twelderly,” inspired by the word “tween,” for a pre-adolescent.

AD

Before the pandemic, I too imagined myself as, at worst, pre-elderly, while assuming there was widespread agreement about the endpoint of plausible youth. I’ll even confess to a shimmer of schadenfreude on reading Texas Lt. Gov. Daniel Patrick’s controversial call for old people to consider sacrificing their lives for the economy, given that Patrick’s standard was “70 plus.”

AD

But then I realized just how much the coronavirus may be infecting all of us with the most dreadful view of aging, in which “old” is synonymous with useless and expendable. And who’s ever ready for that?

Earlier in June, Britain introduced new quarantine rules that meant almost anyone entering the country, including British nationals, would have to self-isolate for two weeks. For many Brits, this made the idea of jet-setting to Spain or France for their annual summer holiday seem almost impossible.

“It’s incredibly welcome,” said Jonathan Smith, a spokesman for ABTA, a trade association for travel agents and tour operators. He told the BBC that they expect a “surge of bookings … although some people may be slightly reticent to travel.”

Under a “traffic light system,” countries will be given a green, amber or red rating based on coronavirus levels and other measures. Passengers coming from countries with a “red” rating will have to continue to abide by the mandatory 14-day quarantine rules.

Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said younger people are often asymptomatic or have mild symptoms but can easily spread the virus to older or immune-compromised patients.

AD

While the virus is most dangerous to the elderly, it can be devastating to younger victims as well, health professionals said. Younger coronavirus patients are a widening percentage of total coronavirus hospitalizations, with those in the 18 to 49 age group growing from about 27 percent of hospitalizations the week ending March 7 to 35 percent this past week, CDC figures show.

Officials across the country — from Ohio to Arizona — said coronavirus cases among young people were spiking as many red states that were slow to shut down in the early days of the pandemic threw their doors open again.

AD

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, on Friday closed bars except for delivery and take out, limited restaurant capacity to 50 percent and closed popular rafting and tubing businesses that drove hundreds of young people to gather on spots near New Braunfels and the Comal River. More than half of new cases in the counties that encompass Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio came among the young, authorities said.

AD

Mark Escott, Austin’s medical director, said case investigation and contact tracing are challenging because people have been interacting with more people in recent weeks. His team recently learned about a large party in the city’s western suburbs that attracted 300 to 400 high schoolers to a single location. The students were together for hours.

“There is concern about substantial transmission, and there’s an effort now to identify those individuals,” said Escott, who did contact tracing for another cluster of young people who went to Cabo San Lucas for spring break and brought the virus home.

AD

Escott said increasing numbers of young people are ending up in the ICU and on ventilators because so many are infected with the virus. Escott said some young people will be forever changed by the virus, unable to return to a normal life or work.

“This is a devastating disease, and this is not something you want to take chances with because the impact is just so variable that it’s very hard to predict who’s going to do well and who is not,” he said.

In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, said nearly half of all coronavirus cases diagnosed after the state reopened in late April have been among people under 35. The vast majority — 70 percent — of cases since reopening have been diagnosed in people under 50. Stitt said the state will not order any businesses to close. More than 12,000 Oklahomans have been diagnosed with the coronavirus.

AD

Tulsa health director Bruce Dart said new cases and hospitalizations are at record highs; 40 percent of the cases and a quarter of hospitalizations from the virus are among people ages 18 to 35. Last weekend 6,200 people attended an indoor rally with President Trump.

AD

“They’re conducting themselves like it’s pre-covid, and that’s not going to work anymore,” Dart said. The younger cohort is “not social distancing, not wearing masks or paying attention to hand-washing. These are the only tools we have to break the chain of transmission now.”

Dart said it was too soon to tell if any new cases would stem from Trump’s rally, where several of his Secret Service and staff tested positive for the virus, and that any impact would not show until later next week.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said earlier this week that the state had a “real explosion” of cases among the young — including a drop in the median age of new cases that plummeted from age 65 to 35. DeSantis’s decision to close bars is an attempt to quell risky socializing; in recent days officials yanked liquor licenses from bars that were not adhering to social distancing and capacity guidelines.

AD

Geoff Beere, a student at the University of Miami and a club promoter, said that when bars in Florida reopened in June, they were quickly packed — even those that tried to enforce social distancing. He said students were tired of being cooped up during the statewide stay-at-home order.

“College kids are gonna be a little bit more stupid about things than older people, maybe a little more reckless,” he said.

AD

Now that bars and clubs have been effectively shut again as the state prohibits businesses from selling alcohol indoors, he predicts parties and pool parties that flourished at the beginning of the pandemic will do so again.

Beere said he is cognizant of the spread of the coronavirus among his age group, but he is not overly concerned.

“I don’t feel invincible, and the virus is obviously serious,” he said. “But in the same sense, I’m young, I’m healthy, and it’s not likely to kill someone like me. But I know it can affect somebody else.”

AD

Beere wears a mask during his daily life when he goes to the gym or grocery shopping, but not when he is at a club or a party.

AD

“I’m not anti-mask,” Beere said. “But you really can’t drink with it on.”

In Oklahoma, several large-scale events have been canceled as the state’s cases have spiked, including a popular Oktoberfest in Tulsa and the state fair. But in-person high school graduations have gone on, and several communities are having Fourth of July celebrations. The party has not stopped at Dripping Springs, the party cove at Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in northeastern Oklahoma, where revelers on boats tie up, drink, mingle in the water and turn up the country music.

“You’re taking a chance going down there, but it’s slimmer than going to a night club or bar surrounded by people you don’t know,” said Kaden Clites, a Butler Community College student from Wichita who spent a day on a boat in the party cove with some friends earlier this month.

Restaurants and bars in Oklahoma are operating without restrictions, and Stitt said in a news conference Thursday that would continue.

“Closing down the economy is not part of the discussions at this point,” Stitt said.

Matthew Broberg-Moffitt, 38, an immunocompromised writer who lives in Oklahoma City, said few of the young people in his town embraced mask-wearing.

Shortly after the state eased its restrictions on reopening, he passed an upscale pizza place in the town’s Plaza District and saw dozens of young people milling about outside, not socially distanced.

“It’s very distressing,” Broberg-Moffitt said. “It’s definitely causing me to lose sleep — and I feel a lot of anger. I’m not an angry person. I was a Buddhist monk for a while. But I’m having a lot of pent-up anger and moments that are almost like rage at how poorly this is being handled.”

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/27/some-states-families-can-start-visiting-nursing-homes-again/"/In some states, families can start visiting nursing homes again/"Barred since March, many have worried that no one has sufficiently taken up the slack.

Now, after tens of thousands of residents died as the coronavirus swept through one nursing home after another, more than a dozen states are cautiously setting rules for the return of a limited number of family visitors. They range from New Jersey, where officials believe the peak of the pandemic has passed, to New Hampshire, which has seen very few cases all spring, to Oklahoma, where even as cases are spiking, criteria have been drawn up to allow family access. But the distancing rules in effect will prevent visitors from carrying out much of their earlier hygiene care.

Limited access raises difficult questions about equity and bias. Not every resident, or every family, will qualify for a visit. Nursing homes vary considerably in their capacity to control infection. The pandemic is still raging, and some states — including New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida — have not budged.

June Cox had gone to see her mother, Dorothy Cox, three times a day at her nursing home in San Diego. “I tried to take care of her physically, emotionally, musically, spiritually, every way I could think of,” she said.

After March 13 she called as often as she could on FaceTime. “ ‘I’ll be there as soon as I can be, as soon as I’m allowed, Mama,’ ” she told her mother. “She’s not a prisoner. She hasn’t committed a crime. She’s not supposed to be living in solitary confinement.”

AD

Dorothy began declining shortly after the lockdown began and died alone April 7 after a seizure. “My mother would still be alive, I’m pretty sure,” said June, if she had been able to keep looking after her.

On March 11, Leonard Beatty of Ashland, Mo., seemed as robust as he had been in months. His appetite was back. His wife, Myrna, and daughter, Cindy Harper, had made plans to bring him home from The Bluffs nursing home in nearby Columbia by early April. The staffers “worked their butts off,” Harper said, but they felt they could care for her father, who had dementia, better at home. He was unnerved, she said, by the “hollering” and crying of other residents.

“Then covid hit,” she said, referencing the disease caused by the coronavirus. “The door slammed. What do you do?”

AD

They visited with him through a window March 31, his 84th birthday, and he still seemed strong. But when they sang “Happy Birthday,” he started sobbing.

The next time they saw him was a week later. “We were shocked,” Harper said. “He was just a shell of himself. We didn’t know what was going on.”

No one from the nursing home had told them he was failing.

Two days after that, a staff member called them and said he should be put in hospice care. He had bronchitis, they were told. He was not tested for the coronavirus. Instead, with considerable difficulty, they arranged to bring him home, where he died 29 hours later.

Myrna Beatty believes that by being there she had enabled him to survive a bout of pneumonia in October. She and Harper think their absence this spring was fatal to him, that he would still be alive if they had been able to bring him home April 1 as they had planned.

AD

“I have to accept this is the way it went down,” Harper said. “We have to tell ourselves we did our best. It was out of our hands that we weren’t there to help him. And that hurts. Covid? It did us in. We’ll feel forever guilty.

AD

“He may not have died from covid-19, but he definitely died because of it.”

The tension with renewed visits is between safety and compassion, said Susan Frampton, president of an advocacy group called Planetree International. Staffers and residents alike shouldn’t be needlessly exposed to the virus. But neither should someone be cut off from all family contact. Frampton points out that family members can spot troubling signs in residents more quickly than can staff members, who may be rotating through shifts and not well acquainted with certain residents.

AD

“Isolation has serious impacts on the health and well-being of the residents of these facilities,” said Daniel Rusyniak, chief medical officer of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration. As with most of the other states relaxing visitation rules, Indiana now permits families to meet outdoors only, socially distanced, masked, supervised and tested for the coronavirus.

AD

New Jersey’s rules are similar, with special attention given to infection control measures as residents move through the nursing home to meet their relatives outdoors. Visits are allowed only at nursing homes that have “attested” to the state their ability to meet the requirements. As of this week, more than 300 had done so, according to Dawn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health.

In Oklahoma, the rules are not so strict. “We encourage families as they reunite with their loved ones to consider getting tested in advance and to wear masks for visitations and closely follow heightened protocols at the facilities,” Commissioner of Health Lance Frye said in a news release.

AD

On June 18, Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott (R) said that guidance for visits would be coming within a week. But since then, cases have spiked and he has announced a pause on further reopening in the state.

AD

Elaine Ryan, vice president of state advocacy and government affairs for AARP, said she is concerned that the states are moving too fast and too haphazardly.

“No state has the infection and death count under control in nursing homes and assisted living,” she said. “Nursing homes are struggling with just the basics. We have a long way to go to have the assurances that these kinds of visits can be done safely.”

But the coronavirus already has a foothold in many if not most nursing homes, brought in through the “back door” by staff, said Mike Dark, an attorney with California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.

AD

And since March, those nursing homes have been operating without the vigilant oversight that visitors provide.

“Facilities have spiraled into apocalyptic conditions without that outside eye,” he said. “And we’re looking for this crisis to play out over years, not months.” There’s no way that residents can be kept isolated from their families that long, he said.

AD

A California woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals said of her 38-year-old son, paralyzed four years ago when he was hit by a truck: “I don’t want him to feel like he’s been put in a closet and forgotten.” He can’t speak because of a tracheotomy, and she fears that has contributed to less-than-attentive care.

AD

“It’s very easy to ignore people who don’t have voices themselves,” she said. That’s why she wants to get back in to be his constant advocate.

Marcia Reimer’s 93-year-old mother, Joyce, was in a nursing home in Orchard Lake, Mich. Marcia visited at least four days a week. “I had made up my mind to be a presence there so they knew I was watching,” she said. She believes it paid off; she has no qualms about the care her mother received.

Joyce had always been strong and independent, Marcia said, but went into the nursing home after falling and breaking her hip. One day after the lockdown began, a trusted aide told Marcia over the phone: “You know, I’ve never seen her mad. But today she was as mad as could be. She was mad at that virus.”

AD

She died May 30. The doctor said it was congestive heart failure.

“She slipped away,” Marcia said. “That was her wish and my wish. She would have hated the drama, that bedside vigil thing.”"/['Will Englund', 'Energy Reporter For The Financial Section', 'A Veteran Moscow Correspondent']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2N553HVMQII6VJB3X2PWJFFIPU.jpg&w=1440"

In the months since an outbreak of the novel coronavirus first surfaced in China late last year, millions of people have been infected, with cases reported in almost every country in the world.

Hundreds of thousands of people are confirmed to have died of covid-19, the disease the virus causes, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. In many places, testing remains limited, and the true case and death counts are probably far higher than the confirmed tally.

“It took more than two months for the first 100,000 cases to be reported,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, secretary-general of the World Health Organization, said in June. “For the past two weeks, more than 100,000 new cases have been reported almost every single day.”

Many countries turned to drastic containment measures to try to curb the spread of the virus. While some countries saw success in flattening the curve, or in the case of New Zealand, driving confirmed infections down to zero for a time, others faced rising case numbers as global hot spots shifted.

The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus was first reported last year, and parts of Europe once overwhelmed by the virus have largely begun to reopen and report far fewer cases and deaths.

In the United States, where testing efforts faltered early in the outbreak, cases and deaths are slowing in some states but rising in others. The total number of U.S. reported cases remains by far the highest in the world. Brazil, where cases surged as government leaders disagreed over the severity of the crisis and resisted lockdown measures, now ranks second for the largest number of cases and deaths. Russia, which ranks third for the highest number of confirmed cases, is also struggling to contain a massive outbreak although its official death toll remains far lower than those of other hot spots.

In May, the World Health Organization declared South America the new epicenter of the global pandemic.

[What you need to know about coronavirus]

In the early months of the outbreak, China reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data.

As the disease waned in China, it began to surge in Italy and Spain. By May, more than 150,000 people had died throughout Europe. This month, a cluster of cases in Beijing linked to a large market has raised alarm over another major outbreak in the country.

While the virus appears to have plateaued or declined in much of Europe, countries in South America, South Asia and the Middle East have reported increases in case numbers.

Meanwhile, many countries — including China, given the new cases in Beijing — fear the onslaught of a looming second wave of infections.

And when around others in public, wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth.

As Avi Selk wrote in The Post’s Coronavirus Updates newsletter: “Virtually anyone can have the virus at any time. You might feel very ill, or mildly under the weather, or perfectly fine and still pass it on to your loved ones. Act accordingly, and be safe.”

AD

Here’s the latest of what The Post knows about common questions as businesses and states reopen.

Is it safe for me to go outside?

For most people, absolutely, experts say. The outdoors may preserve your sanity — and save social distancing.

Experts say that if you maintain a six-foot distance from other people, you should be even safer outside than in a closed area.

When outdoors, “you don’t have to stay six feet away from your spouse or child,” said Maria Raven, chief of emergency medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. “But if you are meeting a friend for a hike or going to the grocery store, keep your distance.”

AD

Dog walking is a good activity — as long as you don’t let your pet get too close to other dogs or other people. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no indication pets play a significant role in transmitting the virus, it recommends you treat them like family members, keeping them away from animals and people not in your household. The Agriculture Department has confirmed the country’s first canine case of the virus in a German shepherd in New York, as well as a few cases in cats.

If I’m older, do I have to stay inside all the time?

It’s hard to generalize, because “some 70-year-olds run marathons, so you can’t make a blanket statement about people’s risks,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. But conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes raise people’s risks of becoming severely ill or dying of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Patients with such conditions die at 12 times the rate of those with none, according to a recent CDC report. And even healthy seniors, Marrazzo said, “don’t get a complete pass” on increased risk. The bottom line: All seniors should take extra care.

AD

If you are a senior citizen or someone who is chronically ill or has a suppressed immune system, see if you can get prescriptions and groceries delivered, or send a younger relative to pick them up.

What about masks? Should I wear one?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing face coverings in public to slow spread of the coronavirus.

That guidance reversed earlier recommendations following evidence that infected people without symptoms can spread the virus. Experts and health officials stress a “collective responsibility”: your cloth mask may help protect others — not necessarily yourself. That means you are most protected when others around you wear them.

AD

Masks don’t remove the need for hand washing, social distancing or other measures, the CDC says. But the agency does recommend masks for “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

AD

The science is still emerging. But a round of recent research, including one review of 172 observational studies, supports wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus. Officials in Springfield, Mo., now credit face coverings with preventing an outbreak among at least 140 people exposed to two masked, infected hair stylists.

That evidence has convinced Carlos del Rio, a professor of medicine and global health at Emory University. “We can stop transmission today,” he said, referring to research on population-based masking when combined with other public-health measures. “We don’t need to wait until we have a vaccine.""

AD

Health officials made clear that the public should avoid using the kind of gear — N95 respirators or surgical masks — that is in short supply and desperately needed by health workers.

AD

Recommended reading:

What do I do if my significant other gets sick?

It depends. If you have been with the person day and night for several days, you may already be exposed. Still, you can’t know for sure, and doctors say it’s wise to err on the side of caution and distance yourself as much as possible.

Most cases of covid-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, and a spouse probably will be able to take care of himself or herself. If possible, the ill spouse should move into an extra bedroom, use a different bathroom and wear a mask to protect others in the household.

AD

If you are living with someone who needs help, you should wear a mask and gloves while providing care. If you are removing a dinner plate, for example, grab it with a dishrag or wear gloves, doctors say.

Even at a distance, however, it’s important to monitor a person with covid-19. Doctors are finding that covid-19 can appear with blood clots, strokes and other serious conditions that require immediate medical care.

AD

What are the symptoms of covid-19?

Months into the crisis, we now know the disease has a far wider range of symptoms than initially thought. In addition to fever, coughing, shortness of breath and other flu-like symptoms, doctors are seeing gastrointestinal problems — nausea and vomiting, for example — chest pain and a loss of taste or smell.

AD

In rare cases, children and young adults are falling ill with a Kawasaki-like inflammatory illness that doctors call MIS-C. Some doctors report brain inflammation and pinkeye in patients. It’s not clear, physicians say, whether some of the varied symptoms are caused by covid-19 or just occurring at the same time.

The CDC has added several new symptoms to its list for covid-19, including chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste and smell. The symptoms could appear two to 14 days after infection.

AD

Recommended reading:

What do I do if I think I’m infected?

Consult your primary care doctor, if you have one. Don’t go to the physician’s office or the emergency room without calling ahead. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and doctors want to protect themselves and other patients from infection. You’ll probably be advised to self-quarantine and, because there is no effective treatment for the disease, take over-the-counter pain medicines such as Tylenol.

AD

If symptoms worsen, and you have trouble breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion or have underlying medical conditions, seek immediate medical care.

Recommended reading:

What if I have other health issues or emergencies?

Norman “Ned” Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, has warned that delayed screenings and treatments could lead to an estimated 10,000 excess deaths from breast and colorectal cancer over the next decade. He urged doctors to make patients comfortable with coming in for screenings and treatment.

AD

As with other appointments, talk with your doctor’s office about their procedures, and the possibility of a telemedicine visit, before showing up in person. When you visit, wear a mask, keep yourself apart from other people and wash your hands or use hand sanitizer between points of contact.

If you think you are having a health emergency, call 911. Medical groups urged patients to do so after hospitals saw fewer patients coming in with heart attacks and other emergencies earlier this year.

Recommended reading:

Will I be tested for the virus?

It depends on where you live and even what hospital or health system you use. After a sluggish start, diagnostic testing is ramping up in many parts of the country, helped by the entry of commercial labs and the approval of rapid tests by the Food and Drug Administration.

Home testing, an early point of interest, is rarer. Since April, the FDA has given emergency authorization for a few tests that allow patients to collect saliva or nasal samples at home and send them off for diagnosis.

Some localities, including in the DMV, say they’re approaching the testing and tracing capability that experts say is critical to resuming parts of public life. And they’re encouraging people turned away by earlier testing issues to seek tests, in some places even if they don’t have symptoms. The CDC recommends checking with your doctor, or with your state or local health department for guidelines, wait times and availability.

Recommended reading:

What about antibody tests?

Antibody or serology tests are designed to detect whether you have been exposed to the virus and have antibodies that may help show whether you have immunity to the illness. They are not designed to detect active infections.

Dozens of antibody tests are on the market, but the FDA has given emergency authorization to only a few. The agency has tightened its initial hands-off approach, removing several dozen test makers from its list of authorized distributors.

Even authorized tests have come in for scrutiny. Some government and business officials tout them as a way to reopen the economy by identifying people who can safely return to work. But many scientists, as well as the World Health Organization, say evidence is lacking that even high-quality antibody tests can prove someone who was infected has immunity from the novel coronavirus and is not at risk of being reinfected.

For now, experts say the tests are more useful as part of research than individual decision-making. “There’s no reason to get an antibody test other than curiosity,” del Rio said.

Should I go shopping? To the dentist? To church?

Any enclosed space with other people will carry some risk. The standard guidelines for lowering that risk help keep yourself and others safe: The common use of masks indoors, social distancing and hand-washing.

The CDC released more detailed guidance for different activities as states eased restrictions. Some of the agency’s guidelines for reopening have come with delays and extended disputes from the White House.

Recommended reading:

What about going back to work?

The CDC has released stricter guidelines for office work, including recommendations for cloth face coverings everywhere, physical barriers and distancing and cutting back on communal items. Companies vary in how they’re handling reopening — one executive told The Post the guidelines were “kind of just a nice way of saying you can’t go back to the office.”

Some federal and state policies may change your workplace rights during the pandemic, and whether you may return or stay home.

Recommended reading:

When will this end?

No one knows. Experts say the social distancing practiced by many Americans has prevented the pandemic from being worse. But the country hit a new single-day high for cases in June, after many states eased restrictions and showed new highs in cases or hospitalizations.

In June, Anthony S. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease expert, told the British Telegraph newspaper that it could be about a year before life in the U.S. returns to “some degree of real normality.”

Public health officials have warned state leaders to proceed carefully and to be prepared to reinstate tough regulations if the number of virus cases surges. Experts say any successful reopening strategy must be accompanied by additional testing and contact tracing to quickly find and isolate people who contract the virus.

Chances are good we will have to maintain some measures — isolating the infected, wearing face coverings, regular hand-washing, some degree of social distancing — until viable treatments and vaccines are developed, which could take months or years.

This list will be updated as more institutions announce their plans.

Fully reopened

Hillwood Estate and Gardens: Marjorie Merriweather Post’s Northwest D.C. estate reopens to the public on June 27. Capacity will be limited to help with social distancing, so visitors are required to make separate timed-entry reservations for the 25-acre gardens, the mansion and exhibitions. (There’s no additional fee for admission to the mansion and exhibition.) Open Tuesday through Sunday. $5-$18. Ages 5 and younger free.

International Spy Museum: The museum, which moved to an expansive new building in L’Enfant Plaza last year, has reopened with a limited capacity and extra distancing. (The museum now recommends a minimum of two hours to explore.) Many of the interactive elements have been modified to reduce contact, but some elements are temporarily closed — including the sections in which visitors crawl through an air duct, and attempt to escape East Berlin by hiding in a Trabant. “An interactive like the Air Duct is exceptionally difficult to transition to an appropriate touchless form, so we will not make it available at this time,” Spy Museum media relations manager Aliza Bran explained in an email. However, staff members have created alternatives in the space: The Trabant on display has a mannequin demonstrating the contortions needed to fit into a hidden space in the car. Open daily. $16.95-$24.95. Ages 6 and younger free.

Museum of the Bible: Even beyond the coronavirus, it’s been a rough year for the Museum of the Bible, which forfeited a rare cuneiform tablet in May because federal authorities believe it entered the country illegally. In March, it was revealed that 16 texts displayed as fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls were actually modern fakes. But the museum is moving ahead. Most of its interactive exhibits are open, as is the Milk and Honey Cafe. (The Virtual Reality Tour of the Lands of the Bible and the hands-on children’s area are closed.) Procedures to limit contact are in effect: Visitors will receive styluses to use with touch screens, and are asked to download museum maps to their phones instead of picking up paper copies. Advance tickets are recommended. Open daily. $9.99-$19.99. Ages 6 and younger free.

Partially reopened

Mount Vernon: George Washington’s historic estate became one of the first major attractions to reopen in the Washington area on June 21, though, for now at least, social-distancing rules mean visitors can’t enter the mansion — it’s just too tight a squeeze for groups on the mandatory guided tours — or the distillery. Still, the family-friendly museum is open, minus the theaters and hands-on history area, and all 160 acres of the grounds are open, including the gardens, slave cabins, farming demonstrations and the first president’s tomb. Capacity will be limited, so advance ticket purchase is recommended. Open daily. $10-$18. Ages 5 and younger free.

Outdoor areas only

Please note that access to facilities, such as restrooms and cafes, is limited. Check before going.

AD

Baltimore Museum of Art: The museum’s two sculpture gardens, spread over three terraced acres, include pieces by Alexander Calder, Auguste Rodin and Elsworth Kelly. A cellphone tour with commentary is available. Open Tuesday through Sunday. Free.

Glenstone: The much-buzzed-about Potomac art museum reopened as “an outdoor experience” in early June, with visitors allowed to stroll the 300 acres of grounds and admire sculptures by Richard Serra, Michael Heizer and Jeff Koons. Open Thursday through Sunday. Free, reservations required. Tickets are released at 10 a.m. every Monday.

National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden: The National Gallery’s beloved sculpture garden on the Mall reopened on June 20 as the first phase of the museum’s reopening. There are shorter hours (11 a.m. to 4 p.m., daily), limited capacity (a maximum of 271 visitors) and a new traffic flow, but those are minor inconveniences when you just want to enjoy the enormous central fountain and art by Tony Smith, Barry Flanagan and Louise Bourgeois. Open daily. Free.

Can Bubba Wallace change that?/"Nearly 57 years later, another African American stock-car racer, Bubba Wallace, is leading NASCAR’s break from the lingering remnants of a past tinged with racism. And he has the full-throated support of NASCAR’s president and fellow drivers, who stood beside him in response to what appeared a hate crime in the wake of the sport’s June 10 ban on displays of the Confederate flag, which Wallace had advocated.

While investigators quickly determined no federal crime had been committed, the controversy that ensued after a noose was found tied to a door inside Wallace’s garage stall at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway last weekend landed NASCAR in national headlines at a time of heightened tension, unrest and polarization over systemic racism and the police-involved killings of unarmed African Americans.

AD

AD

And it highlighted an almost unbelievable narrative in stock-car racing: Scott, who financed his own team until a 1973 wreck at Talladega forced his retirement, and Wallace aren’t simply the most notable African American drivers to compete in NASCAR’s top ranks. They are the only ones to have competed full-time in NASCAR’s Cup series in the sport’s 73-year history.

Worlds apart

Several factors account for the dearth of black drivers in NASCAR, which remains the country’s most popular form of auto racing despite sharp declines in TV ratings and race-day attendance since its popularity peaked in 2005.

Retired racer Bill Lester, 59, may not be a household name among sports fans. But he’s an accomplished, respected figure in motorsports, a former sportscar racer and NASCAR Truck Series regular, with 142 starts from 2000 to 2007. As part of stock-car racing’s connective tissue between the careers of Scott, who died in 1990, and Wallace, Lester well understands the barriers that have made it difficult for African Americans such as himself to make headway in NASCAR.

AD

AD

In a recent telephone interview, Lester distilled it to three:

A general lack of exposure to motorsports among minority youth.

The high cost of getting launched as a youngster, which typically requires significant family investment.

And, most significantly, the challenge of landing corporate sponsors once launched to fund front-running equipment.

In his eight seasons in NASCAR, which included one start in its Xfinity Series (1999) and two in its elite Cup Series (2006), Lester learned to navigate what at times was a hostile workplace as deftly as he navigated the right and left turns of sportscar circuits, where he established himself after giving up a 15-year career at Hewlett-Packard to race full-time.

As a black Californian competing in NASCAR’s Truck Series, Lester found that when he could drive his rental car directly to the competitors’ parking lot on race day, avoiding fans, it was a good day.

While other Truck racers didn’t exactly embrace him, he said he never felt overt hostility.

AD

“They referred to me as ‘Yankee!’” Lester recalled with a laugh. “Yankee? Obviously it was because of the way I carried myself, the way I sounded, the way I talked. I didn’t have any southern drawl or accent.”

The fact was, he said, he was as foreign to them as they were to him.

“I did everything I could to try to immerse myself in their culture,” Lester said. “I went to lunch with these guys at Cracker Barrel, which I had never even heard of before I came to the South. And they told me about Krystal [burgers].”

On the track, Lester said, NASCAR’s Truck veterans raced him hard and aggressive, and he raced them in kind — the only way a driver earns respect. He deepened that respect by winning poles and leading laps.

AD

Lester found the reception less comfortable outside the confines of NASCAR garages — particularly at the small, rural bullrings such as Martinsville (Va.) Speedway, where drivers had to park outside the track and walk through the grounds teeming with fans to reach the garage.

“I saw conversations stop. Fingers point,” he recalled. “I heard the n-word murmured under people’s breath. It was very disconcerting and very uncomfortable for me, needless to say. And it was bad enough that I had to look at those Confederate flags.”

AD

Lester soon learned that his biggest hurdle as a black NASCAR driver — the one that stymied his career far more than the boos he heard during prerace driver introductions for no reason other than his skin color — was convincing a corporate sponsor to underwrite an opportunity to race full-time in NASCAR’s Xfinity Series or Cup ranks, which was his goal.

AD

“People don’t understand how expensive it is to race in NASCAR’s top series, its Cup series,” Lester noted. “It’s about an $18 [million] to $20 million proposition a year, per team, per car. One of the biggest disappointments of my career was a lack of support from corporate America.”

That’s not a dealbreaker in stick-and-ball sports.

At the NFL Combine, a great running back can dazzle with nothing but sneakers, shorts and a scout’s stopwatch. In motorsports, money buys speed, and not even the most gifted driver can consistently win in second-class equipment.

AD

That’s assuming a driver is fortunate enough to get a chance at second- or third-rate equipment.

Launching a youngster in racing these days is extremely costly. Even a 10-year-old’s campaign on a national karting or scaled-down stock-car circuit can cost six figures annually, Lester said. Few families have access to that sort of capital; fewer still among African Americans.

Money matters

Those are some of the barriers NASCAR has tried to address through its Drive for Diversity initiative, launched in 2004 to increase the pool of minority and female competitors.

AD

Its early efforts were criticized as window-dressing by some and well-intentioned but ineffective by others.

In 2009, NASCAR hired former entertainment lawyer Max Siegel, who had worked two years as president of global operations at Dale Earnhardt Inc., to remake the program with the goal of broadening NASCAR’s fan base.

AD

Siegel, who is also CEO of USA Track & Field, said he believed NASCAR’s leadership then and now is fully committed to diversity and inclusion. It became his job to help the sport get there.

“If you want to increase your fan base, fans connect to the athletes, so we needed to increase those numbers so they could connect with a driver,” Siegel said. “We had no [minority or female] pit crew; nor [minority] drivers in the national series. We needed a pipeline.”

AD

Blending his entertainment background with corporate stock-car racing expertise, Siegel launched academies to develop that pipeline. Then he developed a 2010 reality series called “Changing Lanes” in conjunction with BET, which chronicled 10 young female and minority racers in the Drive for Diversity program as they competed for four spots on an existing NASCAR team.

Among those who shined during tryouts was 16-year-old Bubba Wallace, who then went by his full name, Darrell Wallace Jr. His parents had funded his entry into racing at 9, but family assets couldn’t keep up with their son’s need for better equipment as he climbed the sport’s ranks.

AD

“He was so hungry and so focused, and he was going to put in the work to do whatever he could to succeed,” Siegel recalled of Wallace, at 16, in a telephone interview. “He tried to win every race he could, and he’d seek out the advice of some of the Cup drivers and crew chiefs. He wasn’t trying to skip a step. He always tried to get every bit of experience, every bit of learning that he could.”

AD

Wallace, in a recent telephone interview, credited his confidence and comfort in advocating for social change to his experience in the 2010 Changing Lanes cast.

“A lot of positives came out of that, on track and off track,” said Wallace, who went on to claim his first of six NASCAR Truck series victories at Martinsville in October 2013 and started 85 Xfinity Series races before landing his full-time Cup ride two years ago in Petty Motorsports’ famed No. 43. “I think ‘Changing Lanes’ is where I started to learn what pressure was and what stress was, just going from emotion to emotion with a camera in your face 24-7 and not wanting to mess up on television.”

As Lester looks on from his home in Florida, he applauds NASCAR’s Confederate flag ban — something he never thought he’d see — and Wallace’s role in it.

AD

“Bubba has been fortunate enough to be on a platform where he has been able to get the ears and eyes of people across the spectrum,” Lester said. “That’s something I wouldn’t have been able to do, that [fellow African American racer] Willy [T. Ribbs] wasn’t able to do, that Wendell Scott wasn’t able to do.

“ … Corporate America always talks about, ‘Is this person a good brand ambassador? Can they speak well? Do they present themselves well?’ Bubba has done a terrific job of doing that, yet his car continues to be effectively un-sponsored,” Lester said, alluding to the No. 43 Chevrolet’s lack of major corporate signage."/['Liz Clarke', 'Sports Reporter Focusing On Tennis']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MKOLRTFX4EI6VGQ52PNRZPQHZY.jpg&w=1440"

As gunfire rang out early Monday evening here on the city’s north side, Trueblood and six other coaches threw their bodies atop as many children as they could. Frantic parents took cover behind cars, desperate to crawl to their kids but caught in the middle of a gun battle between a nearby group and a car that circled the park, spraying bullets across the field where the Jays were playing.

Minneapolis officials have described an unprecedented burst of violence following George Floyd’s Memorial Day death, after an officer held him down with a knee to his neck, sparking worldwide fury and massive protests. At least 113 people have been shot since May 25, eight fatally, according to Minneapolis police, with hundreds of reports of gunfire across the city, including several shootings in broad daylight.

The spike in violence has come amid a raging debate over the role the Minneapolis Police Department should play in addressing crime in this city. Public confidence has so deteriorated that a majority of the City Council has pledged to dismantle the agency. Some residents have accused officers of purposefully curbing response to crime, which police deny. Others have decided to stop using the agency’s services altogether.

At the Jays’ practice on Monday, several parents frantically called 911, according to Trueblood. Officers, he said, still hadn’t arrived by the time they gathered up the children and fled.

AD

“We needed the police,” Trueblood said.

On Monday, nine people were shot in a four-hour span across the city, starting around 2:30 p.m. That came a day after gunfire struck 11 people during an early-morning gun battle along a busy stretch of bars and restaurants in Uptown Minneapolis, in what officials called one of the worst mass shootings in the city’s history.

Three other people have been killed, according to police, including one in a fatal stabbing Monday afternoon in downtown Minneapolis, just blocks from city hall. The police scanner has been jammed with reports of robberies, carjackings and other violent incidents across the city.

Mayor Jacob Frey has asked for additional law enforcement assistance from several regional and federal agencies, including the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the FBI and the Secret Service, to help investigate and stem the bloodshed. A more robust law enforcement operation featuring the additional agencies was to begin Friday.

“The violence and lawlessness that we’ve seen the last few days is not acceptable in any form,” Frey told reporters this week. “We’re going to restore order. We’re going to make sure that people throughout our city feel safe.”

Law enforcement and other city officials have been publicly reluctant to link the uptick of violence to Floyd’s death, but the incident stirred deep tensions between residents and the police department, which has long been accused of racism and use of excessive force against people of color.

AD

AD

After Floyd’s death in South Minneapolis, scores of residents in the surrounding neighborhood, a deeply progressive area known for its diverse population, said they would no longer call the police out of fear they might put more African Americans at risk. The declaration was echoed in other parts of the city, where the plywood put up to protect windows of businesses during the recent demonstrations has been decorated with messages including “Stop Calling the Police.”

A majority of the Minneapolis City Council announced earlier this month that they would work to defund and dismantle the police department, insisting past reform efforts had done little to change the culture and behavior of the long-troubled agency.

The council voted Friday to advance a measure that would ask voters in November to approve a change to the city charter allowing Minneapolis to replace its police department with a new agency focused on safety and violence prevention. The proposed agency would employ some officers, though it’s unclear how many and how they would operate.

AD

AD

Adding to the tensions are claims from some in the community that police officers have stepped back from the job amid the anti-police sentiment — a claim strongly denied by Minneapolis police officials, who say officers are working as hard as ever to protect the city amid sometimes “hostile” conditions.

Both Frey and John Elder, a police spokesperson, have described incidents in recent days in which police officers were pelted with bottles and rocks while responding to scenes, including a shooting last Friday near 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, the site where Floyd was killed.

On Monday, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo pointedly praised community members and bar and restaurant employees working near the site of Sunday’s shooting for “protecting officers and shielding them” as they responded to the scene. Officers have been working in “unbelievable conditions,” Arradondo said, but they “continue to show up and continue to serve.”

AD

AD

But many residents have said in recent days that they have noticed a less robust presence from the police department, including in South Minneapolis, where they have seen fewer patrol cars in the past four weeks, even as there have been more sounds of gunshots and reports of crime.

One South Minneapolis resident, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution, said after past police killings in the region, officers often tried to ease tensions within the community, by driving around with their windows down to encourage more interaction. “But all you see now is them with their windows up,” the person said.

Jamar B. Nelson, a longtime Minneapolis activist who co-founded the anti-violence group A Mother’s Love, said he knows several people who have chosen to stop reporting crimes because they did not want to be labeled “snitches” by neighbors or others.

AD

AD

He accused City Council members who have pushed to dismantle police of further eroding the “lack of respect” toward Minneapolis officers, which he said has in turn encouraged “lawless behavior” to spread across the city in recent weeks.

Nelson was caught up in the early Sunday shooting while engaged in community outreach with members of the anti-violence group. He had seen just one visible officer patrol the area, even as the street grew busy with patrons visiting bars that had been closed for months because of the coronavirus.

One of the gunmen had been just feet away from him, and Nelson estimated he fired dozens of rounds toward another gunman, who fired back. He saw bodies falling and was surrounded by people he thought were dead.

“There was no fear,” Nelson said. “You get what’s happening from people not fearing police being called.”

Lisa Bender, the president of the City Council, who has led efforts to dismantle the police department, did not respond to a request for comment. But in an interview with the Star Tribune, she linked recent shootings to the usual uptick in crime during the summer and ongoing stress in the community after Floyd’s death. And she pointedly said the police department was still in place.

AD

AD

“We still have a police department today,” Bender told the Star Tribune. “Its funding has not changed from three weeks ago.”

The fear of a potentially violent summer has scared Minneapolis residents still traumatized by Floyd’s death and the chaos that followed, including the fiery protests that burned and destroyed several hundred buildings across the city.

In North Minneapolis, Monday’s close call has forced Trueblood and his Minnesota Jays to scramble to find a new place to practice and play. Benched for weeks because of the coronavirus, the Jays had only recently returned to the park, which has hosted summer youth football teams like theirs for decades.

AD

Minneapolis police officers usually came to watch, parking their squad cars and cheering on the kids, but “in the last week or so, we haven’t seen them,” Trueblood said.

AD

Like many of his young players, Trueblood is black. In recent weeks, the team, which also includes several white players, has grappled with the aftermath of Floyd’s death. They had talked about the images some had seen of the 46-year-old black man gasping for breath, a white police officer’s knee at his throat, and then the violent protests that had erupted afterward, leaving blocks of the city burned.

They are raising money to help pay for the costs of renting a new practice field and transportation for kids who live near Jordan Park to travel there. At a team meetup at a park miles away on Wednesday night, the kids hugged and went back to practice, even as some were still jittery at the sound of fireworks popping in the distance.

As a black man, Trueblood admitted he was “torn” over the debate about the police. But right now, he was more worried about what to say to his players. They were like his own kids. All he could do was promise to keep them safe. But what did that mean in Minneapolis at a moment like this?"/['Holly Bailey', 'National Political Reporter']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R2HCHQVX2YI6VJIQKW7SMSC4SM.jpg&w=1440"

Federal dictates or even recommendations for your own good are viewed with suspicion. And then there are the strict constitutionalists, such as Republican Gov. Henry McMaster (for whom my son works), who believe government shouldn’t dictate people’s behavior but rather should encourage their better angels.

AD

AD

The governor reluctantly ordered nonessential businesses and beaches closed for a couple of weeks starting at the end of March, but has never imposed a strict stay-at-home order, as other states have. In part, this was because South Carolina didn’t have as many cases relative to its population as other states and a surge wasn’t expected to hit until late May or early June. With the predictability of hurricane season, the surge came and most sensible people have begun to get nervous. Yet, with few exceptions, businesses and restaurants remain open, if with self-imposed restrictions and to fewer customers.

Wearing a mask, says McMaster, is a matter of “personal responsibility.” Which should and may be true in some places, but not in our little insane asylum. Speaking of the devil, South Carolina is also home to a not-small number of religious charismatics who believe that the wearing of masks is Satan’s handiwork, designed to block the breath of God. Why, there’s talk that even the Episcopalians are passing around snakes these days.

AD

AD

But, seriously, how can officials fight a highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease against such stubborn resistance? Fortunately, the Bible’s authors thought of that, too: shame.

Though largely banished from the public square decades ago, shame is making a comeback not just here but also in the broader culture. The death of George Floyd while in police custody was finally enough to shame enough white Americans into acknowledging that Black Lives Matter and that the burden of setting things right is the majority population’s to bear. Week after week, we see the remnants of slavery, Jim Crow and the Confederacy being toppled, removed or abandoned, right down to the “Dixie” in the now-renamed “The Chicks.”

Wearing a mask may seem a minor issue compared to systemic racism or police brutality — unless, that is, you happen to be one of the more than 123,000 Americans already felled by the disease. But it’s all part of the same zeitgeist of community, with an emphasis on shared sacrifice and unity. Besides, businesses are getting on board, which can change everything. In the capitalist commune, virtue becomes an incentive and only the morally fit businesses survive.

AD

AD

If shaming the smokers conquered Big Tobacco, could shaming the mask-deniers tame the pandemic?

Greenville, a vibrant city in the western half of the state, decided to find out. Together with the Greenville County government, the Greenville Chamber of Commerce and other business entities, the city recently launched the Greater Greenville Pledge, by which retailers, restaurants and other businesses declare their adherence to state and federal guidelines for social distancing, sanitizing, capacity and employee health monitoring. Once a pledge is made, businesses can download a marketing package that includes signs for windows and counters. Customers who don’t see a pledge sign may well go elsewhere, the thinking goes.

McMaster liked the idea so much, he decided to duplicate the effort statewide, but only for restaurants. Called “Palmetto Priority,” the state program encourages restaurants to complete a (lengthy) checklist of reopening guidelines and to participate in both a required online education program and health department food-safety inspections. Upon completing the checklist and signing a commitment to employees and customers, restaurants would receive a program endorsement and a sticker for their window. The program also includes an online form for patrons to evaluate restaurants’ standards.

AD

AD

Sound good? Absolutely not. Did I mention this is South Carolina? Already some restaurant owners are upset that, under the program, they’d essentially be regulated twice over and subject to the whims of angry customers.

But aren’t restaurants always subject to critical reviews of Yelp and Trip Advisor? The only difference now is diners would prefer sanitizer in their finger bowls. Besides, it’s all voluntary, which should please advocates of “personal responsibility,” as well as restaurateurs committed to surviving the pandemic.

In the new economy of shame, the good guys wear masks.

In Florida, the median age of those infected has dropped from 65 to 35. People between 20 and 44 make up almost half of new covid-19 cases in Arizona. In parts of Texas, the majority of new infections are in people under the age of 30.

This is not surprising — it’s the young who are taking most advantage of loosening stay-at-home rules. They’ve got quarantine fatigue. They know they’re not likely to get terribly sick if they get the virus; many may never even know they have it (which of course makes them more dangerous, because they unknowingly infect others).

They are also getting some blame for a situation that’s not their fault. The United States is in this mess largely because of a failure of political leadership. We should have contained covid-19 much more aggressively from the beginning. Public officials have sent mixed messages, politicizing something as basic as wearing masks. The president himself hosted an indoor rally that is sure to lead to new infections.

AD

AD

Yet nothing changes the fact that America needs the help of young people to contain covid-19. And it’s in their best interests to go along.

So I’m talking to young people here: You’ve upended your lives for the past 3½ months of pandemic. You and your loved ones have made enormous sacrifices. Now, we need your help to ensure these sacrifices were not made in vain.

Please enjoy life — just do it safely. Let’s talk about seeing friends: Whenever possible, do it outdoors. Numerous outbreaks have been linked to what some health officials dub the “serious seven”: bars, gyms, weddings, funerals, faith-based activities, house gatherings, and other small events. There’s a case in Florida of 16 friends who went to a bar; within days, all 16 tested positive. One study, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests indoor gatherings may carry a transmission risk nearly 19 times greater than those outdoors.

AD

AD

So take advantage of the summer. Safer gatherings will be tougher in a few months, when cold, rainy weather will drive people indoors. But what we fail to do now will make it even harder for all of us later.

You’ve been invited to a bar? If it’s crowded and people aren’t wearing masks, suggest to your friends that you all go somewhere else, perhaps a park or someone’s backyard. Similarly, if you want to get out of town with friends, try a camping or hiking trip instead of a resort holiday.

Need to work out? Go running. Take an outdoor fitness class. If you go to an indoor gym, go during off-hours, keep a six-foot distance, and wipe down the equipment before and after you use it.

Dating and sex are more difficult questions, but for many already used to the world of online dating, covid-19 means you need to take it one step further. Substitute a Zoom or FaceTime chat for that first meeting, then get together for a date where you go for a walk — six feet apart. As things progress, have a conversation about how each of you has been considering your coronavirus risk. As for sex, there are safer ways to do this that prevent covid-19 transmission (and protect against STIs, too).

AD

AD

And, of course, wear a mask. Be a public health role model — you know it’s the young who set trends, so set this one.

What if your friends don’t want to go along? Remind them that the more precautions we take now, the sooner we can resume the things we really want to do. Colleges are more likely to open, sporting events are more likely to resume, and we all have a better chance of getting back to normal if we can get the virus under control. And for those who are passionate about fighting racial injustice, point out that everything we do helps to reduce rampant disparities, as it is black Americans and people of color who are bearing the brunt of covid-19.

And let’s not forget that, though people over 65 are more threatened by the virus, young people also do get seriously ill. In Tulsa County, one-quarter of hospitalizations for covid-19 are among those 18 to 35. A 28-year-old woman in Chicago just received a double lung transplant in an attempt to save her life. Previously healthy people in their 30s have suffered strokes due to covid-19; some may never regain their ability to speak or to walk.

If young people are now the drivers of the pandemic in the United States, it is they who also hold the key to reducing infections and saving lives. As a physician, I care about you; I have faith in you; and I thank you. Please stay safe for yourself, for each other, and for all of us.

On the sidewalk, they drew an arrow pointing to his residence, according to the Los Angeles Times. “Tyranny is not the answer,” someone wrote in chalk. In Orange County, in Southern California, late last month, an angry group spoke out at a county supervisors meeting against an order requiring face coverings. “One person suggested that the order might make it necessary to invoke Second Amendment rights to bear arms, while another read aloud the home address of the order’s author — the county’s chief health officer, Dr. Nichole Quick,” according to a report by Kaiser Health News. She was later given personal protection from the sheriff, and then, after another meeting that included criticism from the board of supervisors, resigned. Seven senior public health officials in California have quit since the pandemic began.

Amy Acton, the Ohio health director, drew widespread praise for her calm demeanor and her participation in Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s decisive and rapid response to the pandemic. But as the lockdown stretched on, protesters demonstrated in front of her house. Outside the statehouse, a protester held up a sign saying, “Dr. Amy is Killing Ohio!” Ms. Acton resigned on June 11 but remains an adviser to Mr. DeWine.

AD

AD

Ms. Acton’s experience is being repeated over and over across the country, even as the virus surges out of control in some places. Responsibility for public health falls predominantly on states and counties, and they have borne the brunt of frustration and confusion over the pandemic. At least 27 state and local health leaders have resigned, retired or been fired since April across 13 states, a review by Kaiser Health News and the Associated Press showed. Others have faced ugly death threats and been forced to ask for security protection.

It is difficult to maintain public trust in the teeth of widespread anxiety, harder when circumstances call for unpopular measures. But these inevitable challenges have been compounded by Mr. Trump’s instinct to politicize the pandemic response and drag it into the culture wars. The president eggs on anti-lockdown demonstrators with calls to “liberate” their states; he refuses to wear a mask; he spouts nonsense about the virus fading away; he endorses therapies that are useless or worse. The resulting hostility and disrespect for science and medicine is corrosive and counterproductive. The nation can ill afford to lose public health expertise. It needs the best advice that public health professionals can muster at this moment of extreme duress.

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/25/science-is-better-when-we-open-our-doors-immigrants/"/Opinion | Science is better when we open our doors to immigrants/"As the nation grapples with a new recession, deals with a resurgence of covid-19 and reckons with systemic racism, the war on immigration continues. The Trump administration is now ending visa programs — including ones for skilled immigrants — under the pretext of staving off the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and saving jobs for the American worker. This move will be catastrophic to the U.S. scientific enterprise at a time when we should be strengthening it with investments of funding and talent, all while likely having no substantial effect on U.S. unemployment.

AD

AD

In April, while the government scrambled to address PPE and testing shortages, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation suspending entry of new immigrants, with the stated intention of mitigating the impact on job availability and economic recovery. Since then, several groups of lawmakers have pushed for further restrictions on immigration such as suspending all skilled-worker visas for at least a year and halting all Chinese nationals receiving visas to do scientific research at the graduate or postgraduate level.

This week, Trump signed an executive order extending previous immigration restrictions and barring issuance of several work visas, including the H-1B, H-2B and J-1 programs. But immigrant scholars on some of these visas are crucial drivers of scientific research. An end to these programs, or even a long pause, won’t help job-seeking Americans for two main reasons: STEM jobs have long experienced labor shortages even at times of major unemployment, and welcoming immigrant scientists and engineers creates thousands of new jobs for U.S. workers.

Most foreign-born scientists are on H-1B or J-1 visas. While researchers on J-1s appear to be exempt at this time, researchers on H-1Bs are not. There is little to no evidence that ending such programs would create jobs for native-born workers, especially in the short run. Yet there is plenty of data showing that it would slow economic growth and job creation in the long run. A decision to curb highly skilled immigration programs would be shortsighted and likely harmful to the economic, intellectual, moral and public health of this country.

AD

AD

A nationwide study by the American Enterprise Institute and New American Economy shows that for every 100 immigrants who come to the United States to earn their advanced STEM degree and stay to work here, 262 new jobs are created and filled by native-born workers. The benefits to U.S. workers don’t come just from immigrants who are educated at U.S. institutions: The report also shows that adding 100 immigrants with advanced STEM degrees from foreign universities create an additional 86 jobs for native-born workers. When you look at data strictly from H-1B visa recipients, adding 100 H-1B skilled temporary foreign workers adds an additional 183 jobs for the native-born. Adding 100 H-2B less-skilled nonagricultural workers produces 464 jobs for native-born workers. Another study from the National Foundation for American Policy reports that increasing H-1B visa holders by just 1 percent in an occupation reduces that field’s unemployment rate by about 0.2 percent and increases wages in the profession.

Whichever way you slice it, immigrant scholars (including those on H-1B visas) create and do not “steal"" U.S. jobs. And senior administration officials know this. Ending these visa programs will stunt the United States’ long-term economic growth and set us on the path of abandoning our place as a leader in education, science and innovation on the world stage. There is little reason for implementing an immigration policy with such long-term impacts based on short-term economic problems related to a pandemic.

But that’s just the economic argument. Immigrants are valuable as people, regardless of their impact on U.S. science, and we should welcome the opportunity to enrich our communities with them. Perhaps one of the most troubling things about these policies is that they use the coronavirus pandemic as pretext for implementing anti-immigrant policies that the Trump administration has been seeking since Day One.

AD

AD

The way to emerge from a major economic and public health crisis shouldn’t include rejecting scholars who are ready and willing to help. Science is better when we open our doors to curious minds from all over the world and harness their creativity, potential and ambition. The success of our scientific endeavor rests, in no small measure, on the dedication of exceptional immigrant researchers. This includes, by the way, discovering treatments for covid-19.

We scholars tackle tough and complicated questions in our labs. Rather than adding more clouds of fear and uncertainty to the lives of immigrant scientists working hard to answer those questions, the United States should be supporting their work and embracing them with open arms.

That’s just 10 names of the more than 300 people enslaved by George and Martha Washington. They worked and traveled most closely with our nation’s first First Family as chamber maids, postilions, cooks, waiters, laborers, seamstresses and valets.

AD

Did you know that George Washington had only one tooth in his mouth when he became president in 1789, thanks to bad health and 18th-century dentistry? But his false teeth were not made of wood, as is often described in folk songs and lore. His dentures were made from the pulled teeth of slaves.

AD

Roll that around in your head for a minute.

Did you know that the president was often unwell, having survived two wars and a nasty bout with a cutaneous form of anthrax? He was tended to by Richmond and William Lee during long stretches when he was unable to sit or stand.

Did you know that some of the names belong to people who were “dower slaves,” legally controlled by Martha? She had the money in the family as a widow who was left with thousands of acres and hundreds of people when her first husband, Daniel Parke Custis, died.

AD

Did you know that when Ona Judge escaped, Martha insisted that George do everything in his power to track her down so she could gift her to a granddaughter as an attendant (thus avoiding the need to reimburse her first husband’s estate for loss of property)? And yes, the correct word is “property,” because next to acreage (as in real estate), the enslaved composed the greatest source of wealth for families such as the Washingtons.

AD

And let’s not forget that one of the reasons that our nation’s capital was moved to Washington, D.C., was it was closer to Virginia, where slavery was practiced and protected under law. When Washington traveled to New York — or, later, to Philadelphia — to preside over a newly formed government, he left all but a few of his slaves behind at Mount Vernon. Once Washington moved north, he was legally at risk of losing his slaves in the City of Brotherly Love.

Did you know that Pennsylvania’s Gradual Abolition Act of 1780 held that if you lived in that state for more than six months with enslaved people, they could successfully petition for their freedom?

AD

Correspondence shows that Washington thought he was exempt from that law because his work required that he reside in the state for an extended period. His attorney general, Edmund Jennings Randolph, cleared up that false impression when he knocked on Washington’s High Street door in Philadelphia one day to say that Randolph’s own slaves had familiarized themselves with that law and were packing up to leave.

So the Washingtons came up with an elaborate shuffling plan to cycle in and out of Pennsylvania so their slaves would never hit the legal threshold for freedom. Sometimes they would take a trip back to Virginia. Sometimes they would just make an excuse to go across the river to New Jersey. The schedule was complicated and burdensome, but Washington kept it up because he and Martha were determined to keep the people they owned in bondage.

AD

Washington explained in a letter to his secretary Tobias Lear that the scheme was meant to deceive the enslaved and the public, said Erica Armstrong Dunbar, a professor of history at Rutgers and author of the book “Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave Ona Judge.”

AD

The man who supposedly never told a lie figured out how to stretch the truth.

Did you know that Washington’s cook, Hercules, also escaped? He did so on Washington’s birthday, a departure with an unmistakable message.

These are just some of the stories. (Many others are in Dunbar’s book, which ought to be on Americans’ reading list about our real history.) The Washingtons had hundreds of people on their official slave census. Mostly, we don’t know their names or their stories. There are no buildings named for them. No statues. Yet their toil and their torture helped to build a new nation.

AD

Many say Washington deserves some measure of grace because he arranged to free some of his slaves upon his death. So, he did in death what he would not do in life? We must own up to the fact that he owned people, that those people were separated from their loved ones, made to work without pay, made to live without dignity, made to suffer whippings, made to disappear. Because of that their names are monuments unto themselves.

AD

Names we should remember.

Then came a series of dangerous policy decisions — and a face-smacking encounter with Texas culture — that proved me wrong.

AD

Abbott, a Republican, was one of the last governors to issue a stay-at-home order, waiting until the very end of March and even then balking at that terminology. He was an early champion of rushing to reopen the state, despite saying that he knew doing so would put lives at risk. He barred mayors in Texas from fining people who failed to wear masks. In late April, when a Dallas salon owner was jailed for violating Abbott’s own executive order to shut down nonessential businesses, he called for her release. Several days later, he eased restrictions on restaurants, malls, and nail and hair salons.

Meanwhile, many Texans convinced themselves that the coronavirus threat was overblown, that masks were for wimps, and that contact tracing at open businesses would be an assault on our God-given freedom to shop until we drop.

AD

I haven’t ventured out much, but when I have, the level of irresponsible behavior has been alarming. On one outing to another Dallas suburb, Cedar Hill, a woman without a mask insisted at a Dillard’s makeup counter that she be allowed to test liquid foundation on her face. The masked attendant informed her that it was against policy at this time, and that not being able to test foundation was better than falling ill with coronavirus. The maskless woman exclaimed, standing close to the attendant and to me, “Oh, I don’t care! I’ve got insurance!” She just wanted her makeup — distancing and masking be damned. I hurried and left the scene.

The combination of bad governance and stubborn ignorance has been predictably deadly. On Wednesday, the state reported a record-high 6,584 new cases. Positive test rates are climbing, as are hospitalizations; intensive care beds are filling up. The number of known cases has grown steeply, from fewer than 30,000 when the state began to reopen May 1 to more than 130,000 now. Overall, nearly 2,300 people have died.

AD

So Abbott has been backpedaling. On June 3, as he announced the third phase of the state’s reopening, he crowed that “the people of Texas continue to prove that we can safely and responsibly open our state for business.” By Tuesday, he sounded far different: “The safest place for you is at your home,” he urged residents. And on Friday, Abbott put the reopening on hold, ordering that bars close, river-rafting operations shut down and that restaurants scale back to operating by 50 percent capacity ahead of the July 4th holiday.

AD

You have to ask whether things would have become anywhere near this bad if Abbott hadn’t been so gung-ho about reopening.

You have to work hard not to see the racial divide at work. One foray to West Village commercial district in downtown Dallas featured largely maskless, non-socially-distancing white patrons enjoying their meals and drinks on restaurant patios, while servers, mostly workers of color, wore masks and gloves to protect themselves and the customers.

And you have to wonder: Is it something about Texas culture, particularly white Texans, to believe that our lives don’t matter, but bowling alleys, gyms and MAC stores do? Is it something in our water that makes people say out loud that grandparents should be willing to sacrifice themselves for the economy, as Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick did?

AD

AD

Abbott also announced Friday that federal funding for testing sites would continue past the original June 30 end date, but Texas is about to become a case study in whether it is possible to put the genie back in the bottle once it has been freed from lockdown. It will be difficult to convince businesses to shut down again and people to stay inside once more. It all sounds so painfully familiar; after all, it was the Trump administration that ignored early warning signs and has failed to come up with a national strategy, instead leaving each state to deal with the worst public health crisis of our lifetimes.

Texans, like, Americans, pride themselves on being exceptional. We joke that we deserve to be our own country. But as the number of Texans falling ill and dying of the coronavirus continues to increase, I can’t help but feel like I have come back to live in a failing state.

But he won’t pay the heaviest cost./"In fact, the U.S. death rate was in the middle of the pack for a big, rich country. The United States did better than Italy, France, Spain and Britain, worse than Germany or Canada. Outside of Asia, however, no country fared particularly well, and this is understandable.

Humans assess risks in two key ways: by reference to their own experience and by looking at what others like them are doing. This works extremely well most of the time, which is how humankind has managed to stay alive for so long. But when dealing with a truly new kind of danger — such as, say, a once-in-a-century pandemic — the system breaks down, utterly. Your own experience tells you that modern medicine has brought plagues under control, so there’s no need to worry. Everyone else’s experience says the same thing, so when you look at your neighbors to see whether they sense danger, you’ll get the impression that everything is fine. This is why the history of crisis and catastrophe suggests that most people, institutions and nations perform badly under the initial onslaught of a novel threat.

Countries in China’s vicinity, however, had a firsthand brush with a nasty, new infectious disease: the SARS epidemic of 2003. That experience helped them develop playbooks for future outbreaks. So when the novel coronavirus emerged, Asian populations masked up and stayed home. In Western countries, meanwhile, the virus spread silently for months. Our government and others acted only after thousands of deaths were inevitable and the only way to avoid even more was to send the citizenry into lockdown. At that late date, how badly a country did seems to have mostly been a matter of dumb luck: how early was the population seeded with disease, and did those index cases propagate quickly through crowded super-spreading events, or mosey along through the moderately infectious and the modestly social?

AD

AD

The United States was middling lucky. Note the past tense.

The quality of our leadership might not matter much in the initial “headless chicken” phase of a crisis when no one knows what they are doing, and many of the efforts will turn out to be useless or counterproductive. But, over time, luck matters less and management matters more. We expect leadership to get better, to learn what works and what does not, to understand the risks and progressively fine-tune their response. That is what European nations have done, and it is precisely what Trump has not. Months in, the president is still playing down the threat, still encouraging people to go out and gather in large groups, still hostile toward the wearing of masks.

The effects are evident in the stark divergence between the number of new U.S. and European Union cases. Graphs tracking the outbreak show the E.U. leading the United States until April, then the E.U. curve falls off sharply — from more than 30,000 cases a day to 4,000. The United States hits roughly the same peak a little later, but our curve enters a shallow glide, almost brushes 20,000 cases, then turns northward again. As of this writing, almost 35,000 new cases a day are emerging.

AD

AD

Not all of that can be laid at Trump’s feet. American federalism means local officials have considerable discretion over public health efforts. And the worst U.S. outbreak occurred under two Democrats — New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio — who initially rivaled Trump in their “see no evil” approach to covid-19. But the outbreak has shifted its locus to many states with Republican governors. When a president from your party convenes mass gatherings in viral hot spots, tells people they needn’t bother wearing masks and disparages expanded testing, that makes it very hard to say “No, don’t do those things” to voters for whom ignoring the health nannies has become a point of partisan pride.

So perhaps forgive Trump the first three months as the natural course of calamity. The outcomes in the months after that, however, will be his responsibility. And, unfortunately, the heaviest cost for his failures will be paid not by Trump, but in American lives.

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/26/are-you-logger-or-does-tom-cotton-think-you-shouldnt-vote/"/Opinion | Are you a logger, or does Tom Cotton think you shouldn’t vote?/"Well, this is much clearer! Here I was thinking that all the rationales for voter suppression and denying representation (Is voting by mail good or to be forbidden at all costs? Is two senators for 700,000 people perfectly just or a terrible slight not to be borne?) were starting to be confusing and transparently racist, but once again Tom Cotton has proved me incorrect. It all has to do with your proximity to key industries. You must log trees, not keystrokes; you must mine ore, not data. You must — well, he said it better than I possibly could, perhaps even as well as our Founders.

AD

AD

As the Declaration of Independence said, “All men are created equal, but those even tangentially involved in the production of seafood are more equal than others.” This matter of industries was actually the very thing Jefferson and Hamilton were always fighting about; Jefferson was saying that yeoman farmers should get 100 percent of the votes, and Hamilton was saying that they should save some votes for workers in manufacturing. Both, it turns out, were correct. (Hamilton, alas, perished before he could cast his first vote; he was trying to catch a fish on Weehawken, but Aaron Burr, knowing how powerful his franchise would be if he ever got to exercise it, was determined to stop him. The fish survived.)

You start to wonder how a great many states managed to enter the Union in the first place. Massachusetts has always been rich in fish, but it must have vexed John Adams not to be able to participate in the democratic process at all, given that his connection to that vital business was tenuous at best.

“Dear Abigail,” John Adams wrote to his wife, “alas for this country! I sought all day to Catch a Mammoth Cod but my effort was futile. My Net was cast in vain, but my Vote shall not be cast at All. I would that Providence had made me a logger or a worker in mining, logging and construction. I understand well why we specified that only Such ought to be Represented in this land, but it galls me.”

AD

AD

The popular slogan, “Taxation without representation is tyranny, unless you are not involved in the crucial industries of logging, mining and construction!” rang out across the land in those heady days, and people cheered wholeheartedly, understanding immediately that this was a logical basis on which to assign votes and not some sort of wafer-thin rationale that would be used for denying representation to the many hundreds of thousands of residents of a historically black city.

Before attempting to vote, as Cotton illustrates, you need only ask yourself a very simple set of questions: Are you a logger? Could you appear on the side of a set of paper towels? Are you a majestic redwood tree? Are you a big rock shaped like a human being? Are you several rocks? Are you an ear of corn waving in the wind? Are you somehow affiliated with the fishing industry? Are you a flag at half-staff on the top of a barn? Are you now or have you ever been a worker in mining and construction? Are you an enormous wheel of cheese? Are you a piece of map colored bright red? Do you represent what Tom Cotton would identify as a rich, robust, American industry? (This also includes things to do with horses or involving marveling at the land, staring off majestically over a large field your ancestors violently seized.)

The Founders’ rationale for this has yet to be discovered. The early days of deciding who counted as a state must have been difficult ones indeed. There were plenty of workers engaged in construction in the South, but the Constitution did not technically consider them to be people, so I am not sure how this issue was resolved. My guess is that Arkansas is still not a state, but I could be mistaken.

AD

AD

My point is, what Cotton has to say makes sense and I have no further questions. It is certainly not that he is harking back to a tradition as old and robust as American democracy, that if there are people you do not consider to be fully people in a certain place, you do not have to let them vote at all.

Now her book describes a ‘nightmare’ of family dysfunction./"Over time, she deepened her studies of the disorder, contributed to a book on treating schizophrenia, wrote a dissertation on stalkers, and became a clinical psychologist. But not since she became part of the lawsuit in 2000 against her uncle has she spoken in detail about what she sees as the disorders of Donald Trump.

AD

AD

Now her silence could be coming to an end. Her book about her uncle — “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man” — is slated to be published next month. The book is so potentially explosive that the Trump family is seeking to block publication, citing a confidentiality agreement that Mary Trump signed as part of a settlement about her inheritance. Mary Trump’s lawyer, Theodore Boutrous Jr., said the president is trying to “suppress a book that will discuss matters of utmost public importance.”

The publisher has not revealed specifics, and Mary Trump, 55, declined an interview request. But clues to her dark view of her uncle can be seen in lawsuits, and interviews with former colleagues and teachers, academic papers and a series of now-deleted tweets, including one that said her uncle’s election was the “worst night of my life.”

A description of the book from publisher Simon & Schuster suggests it will draw heavily on her studies of family dysfunction, with Mary using her clinical background to dissect “a nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse,” including “the strange and harmful relationship between” her late father and Donald Trump.

AD

AD

The tragedy to which the book description alludes probably is informed by an event that infused both her life and that of her uncle: the death of her father — President Trump’s older brother Fred Jr. — of alcoholism when she was 16 years old.

Friends of her father’s told The Washington Post last year that they blame his death in part on the way he was treated by Donald Trump, and the president said in an interview last year with The Post that he regrets how he dealt with his brother.

President Trump told Axios that he didn’t think his niece was allowed to write the book because she signed the confidentiality agreement. The White House declined further comment.

AD

Donald Trump’s brother Robert, who filed the petition to stop the book, said in the filing that Mary had agreed after accepting an unspecified financial settlement from the inheritance fight that she “would not publish any account” of her relationship with Donald Trump or his siblings. In a statement, Robert Trump said Mary’s decision to “mischaracterize our family relationship after all these years for her own financial gain is a travesty and injustice” to her late father, Fred Jr., and grandfather, Fred Sr., saying the family feels that “Mary’s actions are truly a disgrace.”

AD

A Queens County Surrogate’s Court on Thursday denied the petition on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, but Robert Trump on Friday refiled the case with the New York State Supreme Court.

Gilded life

From birth, Mary Trump was supposed to be set for a gilded life, a grandchild of Fred Sr. and Mary. Her father, Fred Jr., was the eldest of Fred Trump Sr.’s children, and he was expected to follow his father as the leader of the family business.

AD

Mary was featured in society columns as a fashionably dressed young girl, and she spent time at her grandparents’ palatial home in Queens, watching her father feud with Donald and Fred Sr., who ran a New York City real estate company.

Much to the family’s consternation, Fred Jr. was interested in becoming a pilot for TWA, not in renting New York City apartments. After graduating from Lehigh University in 1960, he married a flight attendant named Linda Lee Clapp in 1962. He went to flight school and the couple had two children, including Mary, who was born in 1965.

Fred Jr. was already drinking heavily by the time Mary was born, and his troubles with alcohol may have caused him to give up his dream of becoming a commercial airline pilot, according to three former TWA employees who trained with him. Meanwhile, Donald Trump and Fred Sr. continued to pressure him to join the family business.

By the time Mary was 6 years old, her mother divorced Fred Jr. A family friend, David Miller, said in an interview that while Fred Jr.’s drinking played a role in the divorce, there was also a lot of pressure from Fred Sr., who Miller said disliked Linda. “She wasn’t welcomed into the family,” Miller said of Linda. Linda could not be reached for comment.

AD

AD

Fred Trump Sr. agreed at the time of the divorce to support Linda and his grandchildren, providing rent and $100 per week for expenses, plus $25 per week for Mary and her brother, Fred III, according to court records. Fred Sr. agreed to pay for Mary to attend a private school during her early years as well as her college and medical expenses.

On Sept. 26, 1981, Fred Trump Jr. died at 42 years old of a heart attack, which the family has said stemmed from alcoholism. Mary was 16 years old.

Carried a burden

Mary eventually attended Tufts University, where she studied the Southern novelist William Faulkner. In a seminar with English professor Alan Lebowitz, Mary and her 15 or so fellow students analyzed the Compson family portrayed in novels such as “The Sound and the Fury.”

AD

The Compsons bore some similarities to her own family: Like Donald Trump’s mother, the Compsons immigrated to the United States from Scotland, and the family was riven by dysfunction. At the time, Donald Trump was running his Atlantic City casinos, which went into bankruptcy, and preparing to divorce his first wife, Ivana, and marry Marla Maples.

AD

Lebowitz said in a telephone interview that he has rarely had a student as exceptional as Mary Trump, who was featured in the Tufts commencement program as having won the award for top English student.

“She was just as smart and accomplished as any I’ve taught in 40 years,” Lebowitz said. “She took a seminar on William Faulkner with me and she wrote two absolutely stunning papers, long, deep and elegant. We studied an enormously complex, interesting writer and she got deeply into it because she is a deep thinker.”

AD

Lebowitz, who is retired, recalled that when she entered his classroom more than 30 years ago, he learned of the weight she carried.

“I knew that her father had been a very sad story and that she was carrying the burden of that story,” he said.

Mary and Fred III had received some financial support over the years from the Trump family, and they expected to receive a significant inheritance from their grandfather, Fred Sr., who died in 1999. Mary and her brother had hoped they would get an amount close to what would have gone to their father, if he had lived, but they learned they were due to receive a lesser amount, and a probate fight ensued, court records show.

AD

AD

Mary and Fred III alleged that an unnamed person associated with the Trump family improperly engineered a change in the will of their grandfather, who had Alzheimer’s disease during his last years. Mary and her brother said the changes in the will were “procured by fraud and undue influence.”

Donald said at the time that he supported a cutoff of medical coverage that had been provided by a family company for Fred III’s son, William, who had cerebral palsy. Donald Trump told the New York Daily News that when he and his siblings were sued by Fred III and Mary, he felt, “Why should we give [William] medical coverage?”

Donald’s brother Robert said in a deposition that the family had given Mary annual gifts of $20,000, in addition to income from family ventures, estimating that Mary and Fred III annually received “close to $200,000 without either one lifting a finger at any time.”

AD

Mary was livid about the family’s decision to cut off medical coverage for her nephew William. She told the Daily News at the time, “Given this family, it would be utterly naive to say it has nothing to do with money. But for both me and my brother, it has much more to do with that our father be recognized. He existed, he lived, he was their oldest son. And William is my father’s grandson. He is as much a part of that family as anybody else. He desperately needs extra care.”

In the 2000 lawsuit, Mary did not directly address her uncle Robert’s assertion that she was “not gainfully employed.” But it was around this time, after working on a master’s degree in English at Columbia University, that she served in a voluntary role in the study of schizophrenia patients, assisting senior social worker Rachel Miller at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y.

Miller said Mary Trump showed an intense interest in understanding what drove people into psychological dysfunction. “She went into a situation that is hard to see. Many doctors and social workers couldn’t go there, it was so frightening to see somebody losing their mind,” Miller said.

AD

Mary Trump accompanied her in visits with patients who were typically 16 to 25 years old and experiencing their first episodes of schizophrenia. “She had her life set on doing what she wanted to do, which was to be a psychologist,” Miller said.

Later, when Miller needed help on a book she co-wrote, “Diagnosis: Schizophrenia,” about the study, she said Mary worked long hours to help her research and write the manual, which became popular in the field and with families of people with the disease.

'Worst night of my life'

Mary Trump continued her studies at Adelphi University, where she earned a master’s degree in psychology in 2001, a master’s in clinical psychology in 2003, and a doctoral degree in clinical psychology in 2010, a school official said.

In her 205-page dissertation, “A Characterological Evaluation of the Victims of Stalking,” she examined whether there were certain personality characteristics that made some people “more vulnerable to being victims of stalking by an intimate partner.”

A few years later, Mary founded a company called Trump Coaching Group, which provided wellness and fitness services on Long Island.

An archived version of the now-deleted company website said the company focused on nurturing relationships. It said Mary’s interest stemmed “from her own struggles as an athlete with asthma which have given her a true appreciation for the extent to which physical well-being is vital to psychological and emotional well-being.”

One of the coaches listed as a team member said the company didn’t develop much beyond the creation of the website. Paige Crosby, who said she participated in a year-long training program with Mary Trump to become a life coach, recalled her talking about her “hurt feelings” from her “sour relationship” with Donald.

As Donald Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, Mary Trump does not appear to have said anything publicly about him.

But when it became clear that her uncle had won the presidency, she took to Twitter. “Worst night of my life,” she wrote at least 12 times in tweets that have been deleted recently. She wrote that “We should be judged harshly. . . . I grieve for our country.”

Mary Trump’s publicist, asked to verify that Mary wrote the tweets, declined to comment.

Last year, according to corporate filings, Mary created a company that echoed the name of the tragic family in Faulkner’s novels: Compson Enterprises. In an initial listing for her book, designed to keep the project a secret, her name was given as Mary Compson.

Now Mary Trump appears to hope that, with an assist from the publication of her book, the next presidential election will turn out differently from the last. She foreshadowed it at 4:07 a.m. on Nov. 9, 2016, shortly after her uncle was declared the president-elect, when she tweeted simply: “2020.”"/['Michael Kranish', 'National Political Investigative Reporter']/2020-06-25 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LLUMSJHCUQI6NJCTDHWEWPIJXI.jpg&w=1440"

At the time, coronavirus cases were rising sharply in Tulsa County, and Trump faced intense criticism for convening a large crowd for an indoor political rally, his first such event since the start of the pandemic.

As part of its safety plan, arena management had purchased 12,000 do-not-sit stickers for Trump’s rally, intended to keep people apart by leaving open seats between attendees. On the day of the rally, event staff had already affixed them on nearly every other seat in the arena when Trump’s campaign told event management to stop and then began removing the stickers, hours before the president’s arrival, according to a person familiar with the event who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

In a video clip obtained by The Washington Post, two men — one in a suit and one wearing a badge and a face mask — can be seen pulling stickers off seats in a section of the arena. It is unclear who those two men are. When Trump took the stage on Saturday evening, the crowd was clustered together and attendees were not leaving empty seats between themselves.

The actions by Trump’s campaign were first reported Friday by Billboard Magazine. As rally preparations were underway, Trump’s campaign staff intervened with the venue manager, ASM Global, and told them to stop labeling seats in this way, Doug Thornton, executive vice president of ASM Global, told the magazine.

“They also told us that they didn’t want any signs posted saying we should social distance in the venue,” Thornton said. “The campaign went through and removed the stickers.”

A spokesman for ASM Global declined to comment.

Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh did not directly respond to questions about the sticker removal.

“The rally was in full compliance with local requirements. In addition, every rally attendee received a temperature check prior to admission, was given a face mask, and provided ample access to hand sanitizer,” Murtaugh said in an emailed statement.

In a separate statement, the campaign said: “There were signs posted and we are not aware of any campaign staff asking that they be removed.”

Trump held his Tulsa rally despite opposition by Oklahoma health authorities and residents who feared that convening a large crowd indoors could accelerate the spread of the coronavirus. The number of coronavirus cases in Tulsa County was spiking in the days leading up to the rally and has continued to increase since.

The director of the Tulsa Health Department, Bruce Dart, had recommended that the event be postponed until it was safer. A number of city residents and business owners brought a lawsuit against the venue manager, ASM Global, seeking to require all attendees wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines from health authorities.

The Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected that suit.

On June 13, a week before the rally, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) wrote to the venue management saying he understood that Trump’s campaign “has presented plans to ASM Global in order to accommodate capacity crowds during a political rally.”

Stitt noted that Oklahoma was in “Phase 3” of its reopening plan and Trump’s rally “proceeding as planned is consistent with the guidance” of that plan. Stitt’s letter added that “we have also encouraged event licensees to refer to the general CDC guidelines for more information about COVID-19.”

Two days before the rally, the managers of the BOK Center had asked the Trump campaign to provide a detailed written plan outlining the “health and safety” measures it intended to use to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Before the rally, Murtaugh said in an emailed statement: “We take safety seriously, which is why we're doing temperature checks for everyone attending, and providing masks and hand sanitizer. This will be a Trump rally, which means a big, boisterous, excited crowd. We don’t recall the media shaming demonstrators about social distancing — in fact the media were cheering them on.”

As the crowd entered the day of the rally, the Trump campaign handed out masks and small bottles of “Make America Great Again 2020” branded hand sanitizer.

AD

The BOK Center also put down floor decals in front of concession areas and put up plexiglass to protect vendors.

AD

At 1:47 p.m. that day, Fox 23 News posted on its Facebook page a photo from inside the BOK Center showing two members of the event staff putting stickers on seats. “Stickers are going on every other seat in the BOK Center saying ‘Do Not Sit Here’ to try to spread the crowd out for President Trump’s rally tonight,” the post read.

After the majority of the stickers were in place, a member of Trump’s campaign radioed staff in the event war room where arena management was monitoring preparations and told them to stop, according to the person familiar with the event. Event staff was told to continue applying the stickers. Later, the campaign began pulling them off, the person said.

AD

In video footage of Trump’s rally, there appeared to be no effort to keep an empty seat between attendees.

Attendance turned out to be less than Trump expected — he had said some 1 million people wanted tickets — and the arena was not full, particularly in the upper level.

AD

Trump had wanted every seat packed, and he told advisers coming in on Air Force One and at the arena he was displeased that the crowd was not larger, said two Trump advisers, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relay private conversations.

“He was quite angry,” said one person who interacted with him.

Trump had told North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) during a May 29 phone call that he would not hold a socially distanced convention in Charlotte because he had never had an empty seat since he came down the escalator at the start of his presidential campaign in 2015.

AD

Neither Trump nor the White House asked that the stickers be removed, said a senior White House official. While campaign staff and some attendees wore masks during the rally, many rallygoers did not.

At least six members of the Trump campaign advance staff have tested positive for the coronavirus, including two Secret Service employees. Dozens of Secret Service officers and agents who attended the Tulsa rally were ordered to self-quarantine.

"https://washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/27/coronavirus-live-updates-us/?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop"/Live updates: Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Nevada hit new highs in daily coronavirus cases/"LONDON — Holiday-loving Britons have reason to cheer: The British government said it would ease blanket travel restrictions early next month.

Earlier in June, Britain introduced new quarantine rules that meant almost anyone entering the country, including British nationals, would have to self-isolate for two weeks. For many Brits, this made the idea of jet-setting to Spain or France for their annual summer holiday seem almost impossible. But the British government said that, from July 6, it will scrap the quarantine rules for several European countries.

The news was splashed across the front pages of Saturday newspapers: “Fly out for sun, sea and 70% off,” said the Daily Mail. “Holiday season back on,” ran a headline on the front of the Times of London.

Brits love to holiday abroad: In normal times, about 60 percent of Brits go on an overseas holiday. Of course, these are not normal times, and it remains to be seen how many people will book a vacation to sun-kissed destinations. But the hard-hit travel industry was clearly elated with the news.

“It’s incredibly welcome,” said Jonathan Smith, a spokesman for ABTA, a trade association for travel agents and tour operators. He told the BBC that they expect a “surge of bookings … although some people may be slightly reticent to travel.”

Under a “traffic light system,” countries will be given a green, amber or red rating based on coronavirus levels and other measures. Passengers coming from countries with a “red” rating will have to continue to abide by the mandatory 14-day quarantine rules.

The full list of countries will be published next week. Top tourist destinations like France, Spain and Greece are expected to be on the approved list.

There was no suggestion that the United States would be on the approved list, although its exclusion could “potentially present a tricky diplomatic dynamic,” wrote the BBC’s Tom Burridge."/['Derek Hawkins', 'National', 'Breaking News Reporter', 'Karla Adam', 'London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom', 'Meryl Kornfield', 'Miriam Berger', 'Reporter Covering Middle East', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Brittany Shammas']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/06-26-2020/t_76a556ce96cb4aaca8be3d51fdfb74a5_name_20200626_pooltesting_pkg_thumb.jpg&w=1440"

Seventeen years later, in precarious shape, a stellar athlete learned what was wrong./"But in May 2001, his energy was flagging. Sipos, who lived in Riverside, consulted his longtime general practitioner, who ordered blood tests that revealed an abnormally low iron level.

Several years later when he developed foot pain, Sipos saw a podiatrist who told him he had osteoarthritis, typically caused by wear and tear on joints. A few years later, a specialist diagnosed his painful wrists and ankles as rheumatoid arthritis, a serious autoimmune disease. That was followed by the diagnosis of a rare blood condition that a hematologist monitored, but did not treat.

AD

AD

It wasn’t until 2018 — nearly 17 years to the day after he first saw a doctor for fatigue — that Sipos learned he had none of those illnesses.

The news was delivered by a specialist whose gentle, measured tone belied the shocking message that galvanized Sipos: Without treatment, which was long overdue, he could die.

“We both started crying,” Sipos recalled of his reaction and that of his wife, Tami. “It felt like the oxygen had been sucked out of the room.”

He credits his survival to the expertise and compassion of that specialist, who continues to oversee his treatment.

Energy boost

Sipos trusted the family physician, who had delivered his sons. The doctor told Sipos his fatigue was the result of anemia and could be easily treated with an over-the-counter iron supplement that he should take when he felt unusually tired.

AD

AD

The pills seemed to work. “For the next 10 years I would pop iron pills every so often and notice a bump” in energy, Sipos said.

In 2007 a new problem arose: The soles of his feet ached and burned. He consulted a podiatrist who told Sipos he had “fallen arches” — flat feet that develop in adulthood. The doctor prescribed orthotics. For a while, they quelled the pain.

By 2015, the foot pain was considerably worse and had engulfed his ankles, putting an end to his participation in extreme sports. Sipos’s hands felt tingly and numb and he was referred to a neurologist and a rheumatologist.

The neurologist told Sipos he was suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome — numbness or tingling in the hands caused by a compressed nerve — as well as peripheral neuropathy, damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.

AD

AD

“He said I should have it looked at because someone 46 years old should not have neuropathy,” Sipos remembers being told. Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by a variety of ailments, among them diabetes, liver disease and bone marrow disorders.

The rheumatologist ordered blood tests and diagnosed “seronegative” rheumatoid arthritis. Although testing did not show antibodies to the disease, his joint pain, the doctor said, strongly suggested it.

The rheumatologist prescribed two drugs: methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and when that didn’t help, hydroxychloraquine, an anti-malaria drug used to treat autoimmune disorders. Neither worked.

AD

At that point, Sipos recalled, the pain was so intense “the weight of the [bed] sheets would feel like my feet were being crushed.” He wore braces on his wrists and ankles in a mostly failed attempt to deaden the pain, and took the opioid pain killer hydrocodone to make it through the day.

AD

In 2016, Sipos consulted a second rheumatologist. She agreed it was odd that neither drug had been effective and prescribed other medications. When they failed, she ordered a test for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, which can assess immune function. The test showed an “m spike,” an indication that Sipos might have a precancerous condition or possibly multiple myeloma, an uncommon cancer.

In early 2017 she referred Sipos, who by then was suffering from frequent night sweats, to a specialist who treats blood disorders.

A precursor?

The hematologist immediately ordered urine and blood tests. On the basis of those, Sipos said, she assured him he did not have cancer, but rather a precancerous condition called MGUS, short for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

AD

MGUS is often found incidentally, when doctors are looking for other things. It frequently causes no symptoms but must be watched closely because in about 1 percent of patients annually it can progress to multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells, or another malignancy. If there is no progression, treatment is usually not required.

AD

“She said the standard of care was watch and wait,” Sipos recalled. That meant appointments every three months to check his blood and urine.

Sipos said the doctor also performed several bone marrow biopsies but the results were inconclusive.

When he asked the doctor about the unrelenting burning pain in his hands and feet, she offered no explanation.

AD

In early 2018, he said, he confronted her. “I’m getting worse,” he remembered saying. Her reply was stark. “She said, ‘Yes, you may be in a wheelchair, but we would never treat this.’ ” His IgM level, she told him, was not sufficiently elevated to warrant the risks of treatment, which would involve chemotherapy. Watchful waiting was the safest course.

The hematologist told Sipos he was free to seek a second opinion. He was initially hesitant. Even though she was routinely an hour or two late for scheduled appointments, the doctor “seemed so knowledgeable and wise and would speak with such authority,” he said. But at his wife’s urging, Sipos decided it was time for another expert to weigh in.

AD

What he didn’t know was that getting a second opinion would possibly save his life.

A dramatic reversal

Sipos and his wife waited six weeks for the consultation with Muhammad Omair Kamal, an assistant professor of medical oncology at Loma Linda University Cancer Center.

AD

Transferring his records to Kamal in preparation for the appointment was a struggle, Sipos said, requiring multiple phone calls by him as well as Kamal’s staff.

Both Jeff and Tami Sipos say that details of the May 14, 2018, meeting are seared into their memories.

“I remember Dr. Kamal leaned forward and in his soft, sweet voice full of concern said, ‘Mr. Sipos, has anyone told you you have cancer? How come you’re not getting treated for this?’ ” Sipos recalled.

The stunned couple repeated what the hematologist had been saying for more than a year: that Sipos did not have cancer and that monitoring was the best course of action.

AD

Kamal strenuously disagreed. “You have cancer,” Sipos remembers him saying. “If you were my patient, you’d be started on chemotherapy tomorrow.” Then he handed the couple treatment guidelines from the National Cancer Institute.

AD

Although he still didn’t have all of Sipos’s records, Kamal said he strongly suspected the principal had a rare, slow-growing form of B cell lymphoma called Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, also known as Waldenstrom’s or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Kamal had seen four other cases in his career. MGUS can be a precursor of multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom’s. Sipos later learned that a January 2017 pathology report mentioned it as a possible cause of his symptoms.

About 1,500 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States, compared to about 32,000 cases of multiple myeloma.

AD

Waldenstrom’s occurs mostly in men over 60 when lymphoma cells in bone marrow proliferate, crowding out normal red and white blood cells. Anemia is common and symptoms include fatigue, neuropathy and night sweats. There is no cure. Treatment typically consists of chemotherapy and targeted treatments that kill only cancer cells. The disease is diagnosed through blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy and can be confirmed by a test for a genetic mutation.

Kamal said he cannot fathom why Sipos went undiagnosed for so long. “He was seeing the right doctor,” Kamal noted, referring to the proper specialty.

When he received Sipos’s complete records, Kamal said, “lab after lab after lab” showed results that warranted treatment. “There are not many diseases [other than Waldenstrom’s] where you see high IgM and neuropathy. Most patients are diagnosed within a year or two.”

Sipos said that when he told the first hematologist what Kamal had recommended, she balked and insisted that her diagnosis was correct. Switching doctors was problematic; Kamal was outside his insurance network.

So another month elapsed while Sipos, unsure about what to do, obtained another opinion. The third cancer specialist strongly sided with Kamal. “If you don’t have chemo, you’re going to expire,” Sipos remembers her saying.

Sipos called his insurance company and requested a transfer to Kamal; it was quickly approved.

He then underwent another bone marrow biopsy and testing to rule out amyloidosis, a rare disease caused by the accumulation of a protein that can result in organ failure. A positive test for the MYD88 L265P mutation linked to Waldenstrom’s clinched the diagnosis. (The mutation is not passed on to offspring.)

In mid-August 2018, Sipos began a grueling chemotherapy regimen to treat Waldenstrom’s. He wore a Superman T-shirt that one of his kindergarten students had given him to every session as a sort of talisman. By January 2019, his cancer was in remission.

But the agonizing nerve damage to his hands and feet continues to plague him. Kamal said the damage is probably irreversible and may have occurred because his cancer went untreated for so long.

Sipos, who sees a pain specialist, said he has been prescribed methadone, which “takes the zing out of it.”

He said he has learned through bitter experience to ask questions.

“No healthy adult male should be anemic,” he said. “I wish I’d had the foresight to ask, ‘What would cause this?’ ”

Sipos also wishes he had sought a second opinion sooner. “I was afraid I was going to offend her,” he said, referring to the first hematologist.

To Kamal, Sipos’s case illustrates the necessity for doctors to keep looking and not brush off what patients tell them. “Don’t just ignore neuropathy, or any symptoms, in young patients. Even if they’re young, they can have cancer.”"/['Sandra G.

That’s just 10 names of the more than 300 people enslaved by George and Martha Washington. They worked and traveled most closely with our nation’s first First Family as chamber maids, postilions, cooks, waiters, laborers, seamstresses and valets.

AD

Did you know that George Washington had only one tooth in his mouth when he became president in 1789, thanks to bad health and 18th-century dentistry? But his false teeth were not made of wood, as is often described in folk songs and lore. His dentures were made from the pulled teeth of slaves.

AD

Roll that around in your head for a minute.

Did you know that the president was often unwell, having survived two wars and a nasty bout with a cutaneous form of anthrax? He was tended to by Richmond and William Lee during long stretches when he was unable to sit or stand.

Did you know that some of the names belong to people who were “dower slaves,” legally controlled by Martha? She had the money in the family as a widow who was left with thousands of acres and hundreds of people when her first husband, Daniel Parke Custis, died.

AD

Did you know that when Ona Judge escaped, Martha insisted that George do everything in his power to track her down so she could gift her to a granddaughter as an attendant (thus avoiding the need to reimburse her first husband’s estate for loss of property)? And yes, the correct word is “property,” because next to acreage (as in real estate), the enslaved composed the greatest source of wealth for families such as the Washingtons.

AD

And let’s not forget that one of the reasons that our nation’s capital was moved to Washington, D.C., was it was closer to Virginia, where slavery was practiced and protected under law. When Washington traveled to New York — or, later, to Philadelphia — to preside over a newly formed government, he left all but a few of his slaves behind at Mount Vernon. Once Washington moved north, he was legally at risk of losing his slaves in the City of Brotherly Love.

Did you know that Pennsylvania’s Gradual Abolition Act of 1780 held that if you lived in that state for more than six months with enslaved people, they could successfully petition for their freedom?

AD

Correspondence shows that Washington thought he was exempt from that law because his work required that he reside in the state for an extended period. His attorney general, Edmund Jennings Randolph, cleared up that false impression when he knocked on Washington’s High Street door in Philadelphia one day to say that Randolph’s own slaves had familiarized themselves with that law and were packing up to leave.

So the Washingtons came up with an elaborate shuffling plan to cycle in and out of Pennsylvania so their slaves would never hit the legal threshold for freedom. Sometimes they would take a trip back to Virginia. Sometimes they would just make an excuse to go across the river to New Jersey. The schedule was complicated and burdensome, but Washington kept it up because he and Martha were determined to keep the people they owned in bondage.

AD

Washington explained in a letter to his secretary Tobias Lear that the scheme was meant to deceive the enslaved and the public, said Erica Armstrong Dunbar, a professor of history at Rutgers and author of the book “Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave Ona Judge.”

AD

The man who supposedly never told a lie figured out how to stretch the truth.

Did you know that Washington’s cook, Hercules, also escaped? He did so on Washington’s birthday, a departure with an unmistakable message.

These are just some of the stories. (Many others are in Dunbar’s book, which ought to be on Americans’ reading list about our real history.) The Washingtons had hundreds of people on their official slave census. Mostly, we don’t know their names or their stories. There are no buildings named for them. No statues. Yet their toil and their torture helped to build a new nation.

AD

Many say Washington deserves some measure of grace because he arranged to free some of his slaves upon his death. So, he did in death what he would not do in life? We must own up to the fact that he owned people, that those people were separated from their loved ones, made to work without pay, made to live without dignity, made to suffer whippings, made to disappear. Because of that their names are monuments unto themselves.

AD

Names we should remember.

According to one person familiar with the matter, the responses discussed at that meeting included sending a diplomatic communication to relay disapproval and authorizing new sanctions.

AD

AD

Spokesmen for the National Security Council, the Pentagon, and the CIA declined to comment.

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the story, “illustrates the low intellectual abilities of propagandists from American intelligence, who instead of inventing something more reliable have to come up with such nonsense... However, what else can be expected from intelligence, which miserably failed the twenty-year war in Afghanistan”

The Taliban denied any involvement.

“We categorically reject the notion of ever planning or carrying out targeted attacks against U.S. or foreign forces at the behest of foreign intelligence or for the sake of collecting bounty,” said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in a statement, “and we also reject receiving material support from foreign intelligence because such undertakings are harmful for the sovereign decision-making of any country and movement.”

AD

AD

The reports of Russian involvement in operations targeting Americans, if confirmed, sparked anger on Capitol Hill and questions about why the administration has not responded to it.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a combat veteran who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump for supporting Russia’s return to the G-7 group of nations at a time when Moscow was, according to U.S. intelligence, seeking to harm American troops.

“Donald ‘America First’ Trump is literally placing Russian interests ahead of American lives, and Republicans do nothing,” she said on Twitter. “Putting party before country doesn't just empower Trump to continue serving his own interests, it can cost American lives too.”

AD

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he had requested additional information from the Trump administration, saying that such an operation would deepen his concerns about Moscow’s actions beyond Russian borders. “If accurate, the administration must take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable,” he said on Twitter.

AD

It was not immediately clear whether the militants approached by Russia as part of the operation had succeeded in killing Americans or allied forces. News of the murky initiative comes as American diplomats attempt to kindle political talks that could put an end to America’s longest war, now in its 19th year.

Earlier this year, the administration struck an initial peace deal with the Taliban. The agreement, which outlined the full withdrawal of the U.S. military within 14 months, was supposed to lead to a prompt start to talks between militant representatives and the Afghan government.

AD

But the Afghan parties have failed to complete interim steps, and with the coronavirus crisis taking hold in Afghanistan, those talks have yet to materialize. Hanging over the process is Trump’s oft-stated desire to remove U.S. forces from the country, where local forces have been unable to secure an edge over the Taliban despite two decades of foreign funding and advising.

AD

The attempt to stoke violence against Americans, if confirmed, would also represent a significant departure from Moscow’s earlier position toward Islamist militants in Afghanistan. Previously, U.S. officials had cited what they characterized as sporadic, low-level Russian support for the Taliban, including the supply of small arms via Afghanistan’s northern neighbors.

After the Soviet Union’s own punishing insurgent war in Afghanistan in the 1980s, Moscow remained largely in the background in the years after U.S. and NATO forces entered the country in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But as the U.S. intent to withdraw fueled uncertainty, Russia has attempted to wield greater influence.

AD

While Moscow’s motives for offering alleged bounties were not immediately clear, officials said they might include retaliation for the U.S. military’s 2018 killing of Russian mercenary troops working for Yevgeniy Prigozhin, an oligarch with links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Syria, or simply, as one official put it, an attempt to “muddy the negotiations on Afghanistan by throwing a stick in that.”

AD

During the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which ended in 1989, the U.S. government provided weaponry and funds to Afghan mujahideen rebels fighting against Soviet forces.

The unit that officials identified as responsible for offering the bounties has also been linked to the poisoning and attempted murder of former Russian military spy Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018.

AD

While that attack — along with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its role in the war in Syria — has generated strong criticism in Europe and from many of Trump’s most senior advisers, the president himself has frequently appeared to have a chummy relationship with Putin, downplaying the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election and other Russian transgressions.

The United States has imposed sanctions on Russia over various issues, including Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, cyberattacks, and election interference. Military officials this month spoke out in unusually harsh terms over what they said was Russia’s decision to move fourth-generation fighter jets into Libya, adding to a spiraling proxy conflict there.

AD

News of the cloaked operation comes as speculation mounts about the future of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. While the Pentagon has completed its initial drawdown to about 8,600 servicemembers, a first step toward a full withdrawal that under the Feb. 2020 peace deal is supposed to occur by the spring of 2021, officials describe the exit plans as “conditions-based” and say those terms have not yet been met.

AD

Even as Taliban forces halt attacks against U.S. forces as part of that deal, the militants have continued to assault Afghan troops, making for what one senior Afghan official described this week as the deadliest situation in 19 years.

CNN reported on Saturday that the administration was “close to finalizing” a decision to remove an additional 4,000 troops by the fall. Officials say that no final decisions have been made but that, conditions allowing, several thousand more will likely be withdrawn by fall.

Her remarks came after a meeting with command staff. Gloria Guillén fell ill after watching searchers comb a river near the base for her daughter. “I want my daughter alive,” she said. “That girl is my life.”

The private’s family reported her missing hours after they last communicated with her and friends could not find her on the base. The family has pressed the U.S. Army and federal lawmakers to pay attention to the case, enlisting the help of Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), a Latino civil rights organization, Hispanic celebrities and Spanish speakers on social media to amplify the story.

Guillén’s family has been critical of military command, accusing it of indifference and failing to shut down Fort Hood in the hours after she disappeared. Vanessa Guillén complained to friends and family about being sexually harassed by a sergeant, according to her family and their attorney, but there is no record of any formal complaint. Army investigators said the harassment allegations “did not produce any viable leads” related to the soldier’s disappearance. They have also said they investigated an alleged incident of verbal harassment against Guillén that they have been unable to corroborate.

Army Col. Ralph Overland, commander of Guillén’s 3rd Cavalry Regiment, said in a statement that the Army takes “allegations of sexual harassment very seriously,” and a separate administrative review of the harassment allegations will take place independent of the criminal investigation into Guillén’s disappearance.

AD

The Criminal Investigation Command (CID) — the military’s equivalent of the FBI — said its investigators have interviewed more than 300 people and have not ruled out anything, according to spokesman Christopher Grey. They began searching for Guillén with the help of several agencies, including the FBI, he said.

“We will not stop until we find Vanessa,” Grey said in response to emailed questions. “Our agents are working around-the-clock and have conducted a tremendous amount of investigative work.”

More than 500 soldiers have searched for Guillén on the ground and in water, using drones and helicopters in and around Fort Hood, but have found nothing, said Fort Hoodspokesman Chris Haug. Guillén is as important to the Army as she is to her family, he added.

AD

The military also posted a $25,000 reward for information about Guillén’s whereabouts. Grey, however, said it is not uncommon for the CID to open cases for soldiers who disappear under suspicious circumstances.

AD

“It says the Army criminal investigators are serious about finding [Guillén], they are serious about looking, and serious about taking this case seriously,” said Maggie Haswell, a former Air Force security specialist who has tracked more than 100 missing service members since 2013. She has been in touch with Guillén’s family.

“They do not believe she left of her own free will.”

The family and congressional lawmakers met with Fort Hood command staff and investigators on Tuesday to discuss the case. Natalie Khawam, an attorney for Guillén’s family, said she was pleased to have more answers after weeks of hearing nothing but was angered by discrepancies in the statements Army investigators made to the family.

AD

Khawam said the Army initially said Guillén had reported for a 3 p.m. check-in with her supervisor, but, when pressed, admitted the report was erroneous. The Army did not say why the report was wrong.

AD

Khawam said she emailed questions to investigators before the meeting and was promised a timeline and records. But when they arrived, the attorney said she could not obtain specific details, such as who called Guillén into work that day and the location of her cellphone. Khawam said she will file FOIA requests and subpoena phone records herself.

“Their answers were not justified. It was bogus. How dare you not be more transparent with the family?” said Khawam, who has worked on previous military sexual assault cases and is advocating for tougher legislation in Congress. “I think a lot of people dropped the ball. They were being disingenuous about their efforts to find her.”

AD

The meeting, Khawam said, felt staged and devolved into a tense exchange because investigators declined to provide more details, fearing it could jeopardize the case.

AD

“I think the most important part is that they are using the words now: ‘foul play,’ ” Garcia said at a news conference following the meeting. They “are looking at potential criminal activity to have occurred. The question is: who, what and when?”

In a statement, base command said it appreciated the opportunity to show Guillén’s family, attorney and lawmakers her work area and the lot where she was last seen.

Guillén’s disappearance is the latest in a series of missing persons cases in recent years at Fort Hood, one of the Army’s largest military installations. Gregory Wedel Morales went missing in August 2019, days before his expected discharge. His remains were found earlier this week, buried in a field in Killeen.

AD

“Maybe if they had just been searching from the beginning, we’d have some answers,” his mother, Kim Wedel, told Tulsa’s ABC affiliate. “You know, he didn’t bury himself in a field on his own.”

AD

The Army declares absent service members as having gone absent without leave, or AWOL, after 24 hours of failing to report for duty. Commanders are required to look into individual cases, but critics say the search is not exhaustive because of the stigma the label carries. Families are often frustrated by what they perceive as delays and a lack of interest by the military. After 30 days, the Army drops the missing soldier from its roster or classifies them as a deserter, and the vacant position is quickly filled.

“They don’t look for them like they should,” Haswell said.

AD

Patrice Wise-Franklin hired a private investigator and felt dismissed by Army commanders when she pressured them to keep searching for her son, Dakota Stump, after he went missing from Fort Hood in October 2016. Investigators followed false leads before finding his body three weeks later beneath his car in a wooded area on the base. He died in a single-vehicle car accident.

AD

“It felt like it was a joke to them,” Wise-Franklin said. “Until Fort Hood makes the hard decision on changing the protocol on how they handle missing soldiers, they are going to keep having this happen with the same outcome.”

Haug, the Fort Hood spokesman, said the Army searches for missing soldiers the moment they disappear. Haug said there is a process by which supervisors are tasked with searching the soldier’s belongings, residence and work to find the missing soldier as the case goes up the chain of command. Grey said the CID routinely opens missing soldier cases.

AD

In Guillén’s case, her older sister, Mayra, was the first to notice something was wrong. Her sister was scheduled to go hiking with friends on April 22 but was unexpectedly called into work on her day off at the armory, family said, where she works with small arms and artillery. The CID said most soldiers have been in their barracks during the pandemic and are routinely called in “if something had to be accomplished.”

AD

The sisters are close and communicate often. When Vanessa Guillén stopped replying between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., her sister was alarmed. Others tried to text the soldier but the messages were not delivered and calls went straight to voice mail. Mayra Guillén said she reported her sister missing to command and drove three hours from Houston to Killeen to start searching, but she could not get on the base until the next morning.

The League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Latino civil rights organization in the country, has backed the family and denounced what it calls the “total and reckless mishandling” of the investigation by the Army CID. It is urging Latino families across the country to stop their children from enlisting in the military until Guillén is found."/['Arelis R.

The reform package is often called the “Charter.""

The report released Thursday by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said the 2019 report — which covered July 2018 through June 2019 — counted 4,434 allegations of clergy sex abuse against minors. That number was 1,451 in 2018, 693 in 2017, 1,318 in 2016 and 903 in 2015.

Of the 4,434 allegations covered in the report, about half — 2,237 — were deemed credible by the church.

AD

AD

Thirty-seven of the 4,434 allegations came from people who were minors during the time period the report covered — eight of which the church-run bodies deemed substantiated, according to the report. In recent years, that’s about average for substantiated, past-year claims. There are about 37,000 diocesan and religious order priests in the country.

The complaints the church deemed credible were analyzed further by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, a church-affiliated research center on the Catholic Church. CARA found that of those whose time frame could be determined, 57 percent of credible allegations that came in 2019 happened before 1975, 41 percent between 1975 and 1999, and 2 percent since 2000, the report said.

Church officials said the fact that there remains such a small number of claims of recent abuse shows that their reforms are working and that the jump in reporting of older claims reflects confidence complaints will be taken seriously.

AD

AD

“It reflects the same pattern we’ve been seeing — there hasn’t been a real uptick in cases since the Charter,” said Francesco C. Cesareo, the chairman of the National Review Board, a committee created by the Catholic Church in 2002 to oversee the implementation of the Charter. “I think the data is out there to show that the Church has been the one institution that has really taken an institutional approach to this and put in place policies and protocols that have resulted in a much safer environment within the Church.""

Some survivor advocates saw other things in the report. SNAP, a clergy-abuse survivors’ organization, emphasized the report’s finding that the status of 863 allegations is “unknown” and another 956 are ongoing.

“Church officials pretend they’re reporting on a past problem when in fact thousands of proven, admitted and credibly accused clerics who have committed or concealed child sex crimes remain ‘under the radar,’ living and working among unsuspecting neighbors, friends, co-workers and even relatives,” SNAP wrote. The Church, it said, should be focusing on locating all still-living child abusers to protect from future abuse and “punishing the still-living ‘enabling’ clerics who are ignoring or hiding those criminals.”

Cesareo wrote in a letter attached to the report that the Church needs to allow a more in-depth and truly independent audit. While the report uses the word “independent” six times, the nature and scope of the audit is determined by the bishops, as are the questions. The audit is done by StoneBridge Business Partners, using information given to it by dioceses. The dioceses also determine which allegations are credible.

AD

AD

A more independent process is needed “if the bishops hope to regain the credibility that has been lost among the laity,” Cesareo wrote.

The report says the spike in numbers is in part due to the fact that multiple dioceses around the country created compensation funds for victims whose cases had passed the statute of limitations in their states to sue, as well as lawsuits and diocesan bankruptcies. The report says such cases account for 37 percent of allegations.

Catholic provinces and dioceses that responded to the CARA survey said they had paid out a total of $282 million related to allegations the came in between July 2018 and June 2019.

Chieko Noguchi, a spokeswoman for the USCCB, said researchers believe there are many additional factors, including “the news of high-profile revelations that also prompted people to step forward.”

It's too bad we have to pretend they do./"This came on the heels of dire coronavirus news. Florida set an ignominious record, with 9,000 new cases reported in a single day. The governor of Texas re-implemented restrictions on public spaces after 6,000 new cases were reported in his state. Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx were back on television for their first coronavirus task force briefing in two months. And shortly after, Cheney was on his daughter’s Twitter account. He wore a navy fleece vest, a tan cowboy hat and, covering everything from his chin to the bridge of his nose, a standard pale blue surgical mask. Typed Liz Cheney, who is also a Wyoming congresswoman: “Dick Cheney says WEAR A MASK.”

Have we gathered here today to mock Dick Cheney, the accidentally-shot-a-friend-in-the-face former Vice President of the United States? We have not. Cheney showed up this week demonstrating that he respected public health. He understood that masks are both the best way to protect other people from your germs, and also one of the few reliable means of slowing the spread of the virus. He was humble enough to do what doctors and epidemiologists recommend.

AD

AD

Thank you, Dick Cheney. Thank you, Mitch McConnell, who lofted a mask at a news conference Friday and declared, “These are really important.”

The maddening aspect of #RealMenWearMasks isn’t the message but what’s behind it: We’ve reached the point of this polarized pandemic where our current plan for salvation is convincing certain recalcitrant men that wearing masks is the testosteroney thing to do.

“People need face coverings that make them feel stylish, cool, and — yes — even manly,” a Harvard epidemiologist wrote in the Atlantic.

Men, otherwise, are less inclined to wear masks. A recent study, co-authored by professors at Berkeley and the U.K.’s Middlesex University, found that men resisted for several reasons: They were less likely to believe they’d get sick with the coronavirus (they are actually more likely to get sick), and “Men more than women agree that wearing a face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma.”

AD

AD

As a result of this toxic mask-ulinity, we have a whole campaign dedicated to slipping men’s faces into some sexy, sexy N95s.

“Mask shaming men won’t work. Here’s what will,” read the headline of a Los Angeles Times article suggesting ways to “make masks and masculinity a better fit.”

Do you have an unmasked man in your life? You could, the article suggests, make sure he had some “tough” looking masks, perhaps with “camouflage” or “shark teeth.” Or, you could pull him in with a little “benevolent sexism,” i.e. encouraging him to think of mask-wearing as a “paternalistic” and “chivalrous” act — a way for the mask-wearer to think, “I’m being a hero.”

AD

Three things:

First, [screams out window for 12 whole seconds].

It’s slightly worrisome that, in order for us to survive as a species, spouses and daughters or sons must scour Etsy for Venom-themed masks so that their 52-year-old packaging-engineer husbands and fathers can feel gender-secure when they pop out to Safeway for some milk.

AD

Second, who knows if this will work? At the Alabama shore last month, a CNN reporter asked a sun-baked man at the beach whether he would consider wearing a mask. “I don’t, my wife and kids do,” he said, adding that he just didn’t think he’d get sick. The reporter pointed out that the purpose of a mask wouldn’t be to protect him, but to protect his wife and kids — benevolent sexism in the wild — and the guy shrugged. It just seemed like most people survived covid-19, he said, so he wasn’t going to bother.

AD

Third — look, we should do whatever works. If more recalcitrant men will wear masks if we convince them that doing so makes them look like Jason Momoa or one of the brothers Hemsworth, let’s do that. Whatever. Sounds good. More than 123,000 Americans have died.

#RealMenWearMasks. Let’s spray paint it on every sidewalk in the country, hire skywriters to scribble it up and down the Gulf coastline. Get Lee Greenwood to write a song. Let’s hope other politicians get behind it, too. (Ahem, President Trump and Vice President Pence?)

AD

But the messaging behind all of this is crap. It presents mask-wearing as something cool that men can individually do in order to be rugged heroes, deserving of accolades for their brave, manly choices.

What masks really are is a pain in the neck. Chafing, uncomfortable, uncool in every imaginable way. You don’t wear them because Dick Cheney decided he can pull it off in a cowboy hat. You do it because nobody can make a mask look cool, but we’re going to do it anyway: be chafed and dorky together, all of us, because doing that saves lives. You can call that being a hero, but you can also call it being a responsible adult.

Seventeen years later, in precarious shape, a stellar athlete learned what was wrong./"But in May 2001, his energy was flagging. Sipos, who lived in Riverside, consulted his longtime general practitioner, who ordered blood tests that revealed an abnormally low iron level.

Several years later when he developed foot pain, Sipos saw a podiatrist who told him he had osteoarthritis, typically caused by wear and tear on joints. A few years later, a specialist diagnosed his painful wrists and ankles as rheumatoid arthritis, a serious autoimmune disease. That was followed by the diagnosis of a rare blood condition that a hematologist monitored, but did not treat.

AD

AD

It wasn’t until 2018 — nearly 17 years to the day after he first saw a doctor for fatigue — that Sipos learned he had none of those illnesses.

The news was delivered by a specialist whose gentle, measured tone belied the shocking message that galvanized Sipos: Without treatment, which was long overdue, he could die.

“We both started crying,” Sipos recalled of his reaction and that of his wife, Tami. “It felt like the oxygen had been sucked out of the room.”

He credits his survival to the expertise and compassion of that specialist, who continues to oversee his treatment.

Energy boost

Sipos trusted the family physician, who had delivered his sons. The doctor told Sipos his fatigue was the result of anemia and could be easily treated with an over-the-counter iron supplement that he should take when he felt unusually tired.

AD

AD

The pills seemed to work. “For the next 10 years I would pop iron pills every so often and notice a bump” in energy, Sipos said.

In 2007 a new problem arose: The soles of his feet ached and burned. He consulted a podiatrist who told Sipos he had “fallen arches” — flat feet that develop in adulthood. The doctor prescribed orthotics. For a while, they quelled the pain.

By 2015, the foot pain was considerably worse and had engulfed his ankles, putting an end to his participation in extreme sports. Sipos’s hands felt tingly and numb and he was referred to a neurologist and a rheumatologist.

The neurologist told Sipos he was suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome — numbness or tingling in the hands caused by a compressed nerve — as well as peripheral neuropathy, damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.

AD

AD

“He said I should have it looked at because someone 46 years old should not have neuropathy,” Sipos remembers being told. Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by a variety of ailments, among them diabetes, liver disease and bone marrow disorders.

The rheumatologist ordered blood tests and diagnosed “seronegative” rheumatoid arthritis. Although testing did not show antibodies to the disease, his joint pain, the doctor said, strongly suggested it.

The rheumatologist prescribed two drugs: methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and when that didn’t help, hydroxychloraquine, an anti-malaria drug used to treat autoimmune disorders. Neither worked.

AD

At that point, Sipos recalled, the pain was so intense “the weight of the [bed] sheets would feel like my feet were being crushed.” He wore braces on his wrists and ankles in a mostly failed attempt to deaden the pain, and took the opioid pain killer hydrocodone to make it through the day.

AD

In 2016, Sipos consulted a second rheumatologist. She agreed it was odd that neither drug had been effective and prescribed other medications. When they failed, she ordered a test for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, which can assess immune function. The test showed an “m spike,” an indication that Sipos might have a precancerous condition or possibly multiple myeloma, an uncommon cancer.

In early 2017 she referred Sipos, who by then was suffering from frequent night sweats, to a specialist who treats blood disorders.

A precursor?

The hematologist immediately ordered urine and blood tests. On the basis of those, Sipos said, she assured him he did not have cancer, but rather a precancerous condition called MGUS, short for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

AD

MGUS is often found incidentally, when doctors are looking for other things. It frequently causes no symptoms but must be watched closely because in about 1 percent of patients annually it can progress to multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells, or another malignancy. If there is no progression, treatment is usually not required.

AD

“She said the standard of care was watch and wait,” Sipos recalled. That meant appointments every three months to check his blood and urine.

Sipos said the doctor also performed several bone marrow biopsies but the results were inconclusive.

When he asked the doctor about the unrelenting burning pain in his hands and feet, she offered no explanation.

AD

In early 2018, he said, he confronted her. “I’m getting worse,” he remembered saying. Her reply was stark. “She said, ‘Yes, you may be in a wheelchair, but we would never treat this.’ ” His IgM level, she told him, was not sufficiently elevated to warrant the risks of treatment, which would involve chemotherapy. Watchful waiting was the safest course.

The hematologist told Sipos he was free to seek a second opinion. He was initially hesitant. Even though she was routinely an hour or two late for scheduled appointments, the doctor “seemed so knowledgeable and wise and would speak with such authority,” he said. But at his wife’s urging, Sipos decided it was time for another expert to weigh in.

AD

What he didn’t know was that getting a second opinion would possibly save his life.

A dramatic reversal

Sipos and his wife waited six weeks for the consultation with Muhammad Omair Kamal, an assistant professor of medical oncology at Loma Linda University Cancer Center.

AD

Transferring his records to Kamal in preparation for the appointment was a struggle, Sipos said, requiring multiple phone calls by him as well as Kamal’s staff.

Both Jeff and Tami Sipos say that details of the May 14, 2018, meeting are seared into their memories.

“I remember Dr. Kamal leaned forward and in his soft, sweet voice full of concern said, ‘Mr. Sipos, has anyone told you you have cancer? How come you’re not getting treated for this?’ ” Sipos recalled.

The stunned couple repeated what the hematologist had been saying for more than a year: that Sipos did not have cancer and that monitoring was the best course of action.

AD

Kamal strenuously disagreed. “You have cancer,” Sipos remembers him saying. “If you were my patient, you’d be started on chemotherapy tomorrow.” Then he handed the couple treatment guidelines from the National Cancer Institute.

AD

Although he still didn’t have all of Sipos’s records, Kamal said he strongly suspected the principal had a rare, slow-growing form of B cell lymphoma called Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, also known as Waldenstrom’s or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Kamal had seen four other cases in his career. MGUS can be a precursor of multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom’s. Sipos later learned that a January 2017 pathology report mentioned it as a possible cause of his symptoms.

About 1,500 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States, compared to about 32,000 cases of multiple myeloma.

AD

Waldenstrom’s occurs mostly in men over 60 when lymphoma cells in bone marrow proliferate, crowding out normal red and white blood cells. Anemia is common and symptoms include fatigue, neuropathy and night sweats. There is no cure. Treatment typically consists of chemotherapy and targeted treatments that kill only cancer cells. The disease is diagnosed through blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy and can be confirmed by a test for a genetic mutation.

Kamal said he cannot fathom why Sipos went undiagnosed for so long. “He was seeing the right doctor,” Kamal noted, referring to the proper specialty.

When he received Sipos’s complete records, Kamal said, “lab after lab after lab” showed results that warranted treatment. “There are not many diseases [other than Waldenstrom’s] where you see high IgM and neuropathy. Most patients are diagnosed within a year or two.”

Sipos said that when he told the first hematologist what Kamal had recommended, she balked and insisted that her diagnosis was correct. Switching doctors was problematic; Kamal was outside his insurance network.

So another month elapsed while Sipos, unsure about what to do, obtained another opinion. The third cancer specialist strongly sided with Kamal. “If you don’t have chemo, you’re going to expire,” Sipos remembers her saying.

Sipos called his insurance company and requested a transfer to Kamal; it was quickly approved.

He then underwent another bone marrow biopsy and testing to rule out amyloidosis, a rare disease caused by the accumulation of a protein that can result in organ failure. A positive test for the MYD88 L265P mutation linked to Waldenstrom’s clinched the diagnosis. (The mutation is not passed on to offspring.)

In mid-August 2018, Sipos began a grueling chemotherapy regimen to treat Waldenstrom’s. He wore a Superman T-shirt that one of his kindergarten students had given him to every session as a sort of talisman. By January 2019, his cancer was in remission.

But the agonizing nerve damage to his hands and feet continues to plague him. Kamal said the damage is probably irreversible and may have occurred because his cancer went untreated for so long.

Sipos, who sees a pain specialist, said he has been prescribed methadone, which “takes the zing out of it.”

He said he has learned through bitter experience to ask questions.

“No healthy adult male should be anemic,” he said. “I wish I’d had the foresight to ask, ‘What would cause this?’ ”

Sipos also wishes he had sought a second opinion sooner. “I was afraid I was going to offend her,” he said, referring to the first hematologist.

To Kamal, Sipos’s case illustrates the necessity for doctors to keep looking and not brush off what patients tell them. “Don’t just ignore neuropathy, or any symptoms, in young patients. Even if they’re young, they can have cancer.”"/['Sandra G.

“There’s no place for racism in our game, nor anywhere else,” the company said in a statement announcing its action.

AD

With the country roiled by tensions and protests over African Americans’ deaths at the hands of police, the issues entangling Magic and its creators are unlikely to subside soon. The fantasy game of goblins, elves, spells and more boasts some 20 million players, and in pre-pandemic times, thousands flocked to elite international tournaments with hefty prizes. Players of color say they have long felt excluded in the white- and male-dominated community from the game’s top echelons, as well as employment at the company.

AD

Wizards has “a long unbroken pattern of insidious racist behavior wrapped in self-congratulatory praise,” wrote Zaiem Beg, a prominent Pakistani-American commentator who analyzes the game’s strategy and tournaments. His is one of numerous letters now circulating on social media.

“Both Wizards and the community at large are guilty of making black people feel unwelcome in Magic,” wrote Lawrence Harmon, a black player who hosts a podcast about the game. “It’s time that changed.”

AD

An endorsement from the company, which also produces Dungeons & Dragons, can boost the livelihoods of players, artists and commentators. A lack of support can have the opposite effect. Critics say individuals who speak out risk being shut out of certain high-profile competitions or opportunities to create content for the company.

AD

The Wizards announcement did not address those issues, and a spokesman declined to comment. Yet its statement this month identified a clear impetus.

“The events of the past weeks and the ongoing conversation about how we can better support people of color have caused us to examine ourselves, our actions, and our inactions,” it said. “We appreciate everyone helping us to recognize when we fall short. We should have been better, we can be better, and we will be better.”

AD

Wizards subsequently pledged to review every Magic card printed — a considerable undertaking given that 20,000 unique cards are in circulation. “This first pass isn't meant to be an exhaustive catalogue of every problematic card in Magic’s history,” the company tweeted, “and we will continue to take actions on similar cards in the future.""

AD

The game's lead designer — an icon in the Magic community — offered a mea culpa of sorts on his personal blog.

“I’m a white man that grew up in America in the ’70s and ’80s,” Mark Rosewater explained. “I need to recognize that a lot of things I’ve internalized as normal and ‘just part of life’ have ugly aspects tied to them. I need to self-educate to understand these biases so that I can remove them.”

AD

The company did not provide an explanation of the thought process behind the banned cards. The former art director who approved the image for “Invoke Prejudice,” Jesper Myrfors, commented on the controversy in a defensive Facebook post. Pulling that card “was the right call,” he said, even though its characters, while looking “like KKK members,” had actually been inspired by the Spanish Inquisition.

AD

In a separate Facebook post, the card’s artist also linked the scene to the Inquisition. “The later rather insulting assumptions and accompanying venom were a bit sad to me,” Harold McNeill added.

McNeill, once a regular contributor to Magic, has a personal website filled with drawings of swastikas, Adolf Hitler, crusader knights and highly sexualized depictions of women. For years, Magic players have raised questions about his use of fascist imagery and why “Invoke Prejudice” was ever released.

AD

Neither Myrfors nor McNeill could be reached for comment.

Ebony Elizabeth Thomas, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies race in fantasy worlds and young adult literature, says racism in popular media can play a pernicious role in reinforcing negative attitudes about minority groups.

AD

“If all your life you’ve been fed a steady diet of black people not mattering in your fantasy world, in your playtime, then why in the real world would you think that black people’s lives matter?” she said in an interview last week.

Thomas noted that the KKK itself drew on historical imagery such as the Inquisition to evoke an imagined ideal past. There’s a similar danger even when the imagining is for something as innocuous as a game, she said.

AD

“I feel like these things inter-animate one another,” she noted. “Every time we encounter some racist backlash, we tend to want to go back to some imaginary past that was somehow purer.”

For the moment, players of color say they would appreciate at least being recognized for their accomplishments.

Greg Orange, a professional player from Minneapolis who is biracial, won a high-profile tournament in 2018 — a victory that made him the fifth-ranked player in the world. Still, he and critics say, Wizards officials repeatedly overlooked him in favor of white players when selecting participants for their top invitational tournaments.

AD

Orange lives in the same city where a police officer in late May knelt on George Floyd’s neck for more than eight ultimately fatal minutes. He has mostly stayed home of late, “freaked out” by the confrontations that erupted there between police and protesters reacting to Floyd’s death.

AD

Early this month, in response to the turmoil nationwide, Wizards sent out tweets highlighting Magic players of color and expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

Please see the Online Tracking and Advertising section and visit our Ad Choices pages for further information about how to disable cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to certain types of targeted advertising.

Other Choices. The local laws where you live (e.g., laws of the E.U. and California) may permit you to make certain requests. See the section applicable to the place of your residency below.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In the meantime, please see Online Tracking & Advertising for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.

Data Security

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

Children’s Privacy. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

Online Tracking & Advertising

How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How To Disable These Technologies

We, our service providers, and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality or measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.

Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service.

Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because the• Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.

Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.

Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising

As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.

In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .

Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Please visit our Ad Choices page for additional information and privacy choices.

Van Drew/"Now, the mother of five is running in a key congressional battleground that has the backdrop of President Trump and a Democratic vendetta to take out a once trusted ally who betrayed them.

And, in perhaps the most unusual fashion, she is running as an outsider, trying to establish a new beachhead for one of the most famous families in Democratic politics.

AD

“It’s not the name, it’s more people just associate that legacy with kind of the unfinished work of social justice. And that’s what I think people are really hungry for right now,” Kennedy said Wednesday in an hour-long interview at her house on the bay.

AD

The irony is not lost on Kennedy’s main opponent, who has spent 20 years as a political commentator in New Jersey, a tenure that helped to quickly win the backing of six of the eight Democratic county chairmen in this district.

“The Kennedys as outsiders,” Brigid Callahan Harrison said Wednesday, in an hour-long telephone interview, amazed at how much the race is pivoting on personality. “That is how they’re marketing this.”

AD

So, as voters check off their mail ballots in this pandemic-era July 7 election, the battle is coming down to two powerful, yet very different political machines: the Kennedys versus South Jersey power brokers.

Neither Kennedy nor Harrison is really supposed to be running for this seat.

For Kennedy, her destiny flipped after a chance meeting in 2010 at an Atlantic City conference on mental health, with then-Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy (D-R.I.) headlining. He was winding down the last months of a 16-year career in Congress, one that had seen plenty of public battles with substance abuse. His family’s history with mental illness had made that the central cause of his public service.

AD

AD

A few months before his father, Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a legendary senator of almost 47 years, lost his fight with brain cancer.

By July 2011 he and Amy married at Hyannisport, the family compound on Cape Cod where so many Kennedy campaigns had been mapped out. But instead of settling in New England, he moved about 400 miles down the coast to Brigantine, leaving behind the family business.

Harrison, after losing a local municipal race in the late 1990s, was hired as a political science professor at Montclair State University. She did commentary on local TV and wrote a regular column in some New Jersey papers, always engaged in policy without ever fully entering the arena herself.

AD

In 2018, Democratic women, many running for the first time, racked up wins and handed the gavel back to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), while South Jersey Democrats supported a socially conservative white man: Jeff Van Drew, who had climbed his way up the ladder of state politics in Trenton.

AD

“I held my nose and voted for him,” Harrison, 55, said.

Then came Van Drew’s vote on Halloween to oppose Pelosi’s move toward impeaching the president over the Ukraine scandal.

“I was sick to my stomach,” Harrison recalled.

So she began floating her name as a potential primary opponent. She talked to party operatives and, having never really raised campaign funds, asked Patrick Kennedy if he would join her finance team if she went through with it.

AD

Van Drew did not just oppose impeachment — he switched parties and, in the Oval Office, shook Trump’s hand and pledged his loyalty. Amy Kennedy felt sick to her stomach.

“How is that possible? And kind of knowing the significance there, and what that meant for this upcoming election, how it would then become a race about Trump really — that felt like the moment,” she said.

AD

By the time she entered the race, Harrison had already locked down much of the establishment support.

So Harrison, who began as an insurgent challenging a favorite Democratic son, has become the establishment pick, including an unusual alignment with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) so that their names are bracketed together on the primary ballots.

AD

Kennedy, with a last name that is synonymous with Democratic power, is now running as the outsider in a district that she has lived and worked in her entire life.

What has ensued is an increasingly bitter, personal campaign that is befitting of this state’s bare-knuckle traditions.

Moreover, with Gov. Phil Murphy (D) endorsing Kennedy, New Jersey’s intensely myopic insider class has lost focus on defeating Van Drew and instead see this primary as a proxy fight in a long-running civil war.

AD

Murphy has clashed with Democratic power broker George Norcross and his protege, state Senate President John Sweeney (D), from almost his first day in office in January 2018. Norcross, a private businessman, does not technically hold an official party position but his influence resembles a character from the HBO show “Boardwalk Empire,” about Atlantic City during Prohibition.

Kennedy is trying to overcome that influence with a mix of hometown tied to an incredible legacy. Her Brigantine home is filled with family memorabilia, including a framed box of all the airline tickets that Patrick Kennedy collected as he traveled across the country in 2000 as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

AD

She is viewed fondly by her extended family, someone who helped anchor Patrick Kennedy’s life. They have four children together, and he is a doting stepfather to her eldest daughter.

AD

“She’s fantastic,” Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) said.

Joe Kennedy laughed at the idea of his cousin by marriage running as an outsider, as he is in the midst of a challenge to Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).

The covid pandemic has limited how much in-person campaigning the Kennedys can do, but the family is helping where it can. Joe Kennedy did a Facebook Live chat with Amy Kennedy.

A piece of mail includes images of John F. Kennedy as president and his son saluting his casket at his funeral after the 1963 assassination, among other iconic pictures.

AD

“Ask not what your country can do for you,” it says, “ask what Amy Kennedy can do for your country.”

All of this has pushed Harrison to complain that her opponent is running “exclusively on the fact that she married someone with a famous last name.”

The two largely agree on policy, but Harrison stresses, “I know policy, so there’s a big difference. I’m a candidate of substance.”

AD

Kennedy dismisses those attacks as academic elitism, incapable of connecting with typical voters. “To really connect with people, that’s more about the personal stories that they have,” she said.

A victory here, in the primary and over Van Drew, would demonstrate the Kennedy name still resonates."/['Paul Kane', 'Senior Congressional Correspondent']/2020-06-27 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AC3EFFYTQI6VLFF5O3D2J7B74.jpg&w=1440"

AD

AD

“Nothing the 2017 Congress did demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the ACA to continue to operate in the absence of these three integral provisions. The entire ACA thus must fall with the individual mandate,” the brief said.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted that his administration is “asking the Supreme Court that Obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a FAR BETTER AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE.”

Republican officials and strategists working on competitive campaigns were privately aghast Friday at the administration’s decision to reignite the issue, particularly as health care is at the forefront of voters’ minds because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

AD

The ties between the pandemic and access to Obamacare were underscored this week with a new report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which found that 487,000 Americans used a special enrollment period for the health care law after losing their own coverage, probably due to job losses.

AD

“To take that issue to the Supreme Court, in the middle of a pandemic, shows that there’s a lack of understanding about the fear out there in this country,” said Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), who hails from one of the most closely watched presidential battleground states. “I think that we need to talk about it so that people understand what’s going on.”

The potency of health care as an issue was evident in advance of the filing, with Democrats — anticipating the Thursday deadline for the Justice Department to respond in the case — eagerly holding media calls promoting the Affordable Care Act and attacking incumbent Republican senators for their attempts to repeal it or insufficiently defend it.

AD

In Maine, Democrat Sara Gideon, who is running against Sen. Susan Collins (R), criticized the four-term senator for casting a “key vote” that prompted the legal challenge from the Republican attorneys general. Collins has voted against repealing the health care law, but supported a separate law enacted in 2017 that effectively eliminated Obamacare’s requirement that everyone hold insurance.

AD

Collins, in a statement Friday, said the Justice Department arrived at the “wrong conclusion” in its argument in court, saying it was never the intent of lawmakers to repeal the entire health care law when the Republican-controlled Congress got rid of its individual mandate through the 2017 tax cut bill.

“The administration’s decision to submit this new brief is the wrong policy at the worst possible time as our nation is in the midst of a pandemic,” Collins said in a statement to The Washington Post. “The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, and it is the Department of Justice’s duty to defend it.”

AD

But with its legal filing, the Trump administration directly contradicted that position, arguing that even provisions regarding preexisting conditions or high-risk medical histories could not be severed from the mandate.

AD

The administration’s aggressive argument against Obamacare comes amid heightened concerns from Republicans about their overall electoral fortunes this fall due to the president’s handling of the cratering economy, a national uprising over racism and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Democrats have largely credited their winning back the House majority in 2018 to health care, and they’ve seized on Trump and congressional Republicans’ repeated efforts to repeal it in campaigns. The GOP mantra for a decade has been “repeal and replace,” but the party has never been able to coalesce around an alternative.

AD

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also jumped on the issue this week, saying during a campaign swing in Pennsylvania on Thursday that Trump’s “twin legacies” are “his failure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take health-care protections away from American families.”

AD

At a virtual fundraiser Friday, Biden said, “Millions have contracted coronavirus, people need a lifeline. And they don’t need a president suing to deny them health care.”

The Biden campaign put an emphasis on the Trump administration’s move against the Affordable Care Act on Friday, hosting events with surrogates designed to draw a sharp contrast with the president.

AD

Former second lady Jill Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) held a virtual event with supporters in Wisconsin, a key battleground. “This administration is trying to take health care away from million of Americans. That’s it,” said Harris, who is under consideration to be Biden’s running mate.

Jill Biden promoted the steps Biden would take to add to the ACA, rather than tear it down. She mentioned his support for an optional public insurance program, among other things.

AD

“This matters to Joe,” she said. “And you matter to him.”

A Kaiser Family Foundation poll this month found that 53 percent of voters trust Biden more on health care issues, compared with 38 percent for Trump. And according to internal Democratic polling of key Senate battleground states conducted in May, GOP support for the legal challenge against Obamacare was the top negative against Senate Republicans, particularly among swing and independent voters, according to a party official familiar with the numbers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the findings.

AD

“Americans should look at what the Trump administration and Republicans do — not what they say — on health care,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Republicans remain unflinching in their cruel and callous campaign to eliminate Americans’ health-care coverage, even as the country faces down the biggest global health crisis in recent history.”

AD

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Democrats will force Republicans to cast a tough vote on the issue next week. She introduced a bill Wednesday that would broaden the reach of the law and make it available to more Americans.

The bill would penalize states that do not expand Medicaid and expand subsidies for people who buy private health plans in the insurance marketplaces created under the law for individuals and families who do not have access to affordable health-care benefits through a job.

AD

Responding to the court filing late Thursday, Pelosi said Trump and Republicans’ “campaign to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis is an act of unfathomable cruelty.”

Health care has also been a dominant theme in televisions spots run this week by Democratic Senate candidates and groups working to elect them, popping up as an issue in ads in Arizona, Montana, North Carolina and Colorado.

AD

In private, Republican officials working on down-ballot races vented their frustration with the administration’s decision to revive the health care fight, while acknowledging that repealing Obamacare remains a core issue for their base. The timing of the filing, amid the pandemic, was also particularly unhelpful, according to Republicans.

“In a sea of stupid decisions this administration makes on a daily basis, this one stands out,” complained one Senate GOP aide Friday, granted anonymity to candidly assess the White House’s moves.

Some in the Trump administration, including Attorney General William P. Barr, have privately argued parts of the law should be preserved amid a pandemic. In a meeting last month, Barr made that argument with senior officials, but days later, Trump told reporters, “We want to terminate health care under Obamacare.”

Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said after the brief was submitted that “a global pandemic does not change what Americans know: Obamacare has been an unlawful failure and further illustrates the need to focus on patient care.”

“The American people deserve for Congress to work on a bipartisan basis with the President to provide quality, affordable care,” Deere said.

Oral arguments in the case aren’t scheduled until the next Supreme Court term, which begins in October. It’s unclear whether they will occur before the Nov. 3 election.

Some conservative lawmakers largely shrugged, noting that the Republican Party has tried to overturn the health care law ever since it was enacted in 2010.

“We’ve been trying to overcome the detrimental effects of the ACA for a long time,” said Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), who is running for one of two Senate seats in Georgia. “That was one of the biggest things that I think that the Republican majority, looking back on, I wish that we could have passed and got done.”

Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Reps. Val Demings (D-Fla.) and Karen Bass (D-Calif.) — are on the shortlist of potential running mates for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

And with black candidates around the nation channeling the public clamor for equality into likely primary upsets last Tuesday, the group is poised to expand its ranks next year — when it marks its 50th anniversary.

AD

AD

“I’ve seen the CBC since its inception, and this is quite a moment where everything has come together,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.). “It’s sort of something that I know the founders of the CBC dreamed of, worked for . . . envisioned. . . . People are beginning to recognize this.”

Lee reminisced about one of the original 13 members of the caucus, Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.), the first black woman elected to Congress. Lee worked on Chisholm’s 1972 presidential campaign, called her a friend and her mentor, and recalled that Chisholm had to “fight just to get a seat at the table.”

Members of the caucus are already making plans to capitalize on the moment, eyeing two possible vacancies in chairmanships to increase their clout. Although mail ballots are still being counted, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) trails rival Jamaal Bowman, an African American former middle school principal.

AD

AD

Caucus members are uniting behind one of their own to replace Engel and lead the committee: Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.). The panel has never had a black chairman.

Members are also discussing the possibility of Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) taking the gavel as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. The current chairman, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), is locked in a close race that is also contingent on tens of thousands of mail ballots.

Looking beyond Congress to the November election, caucus members are upbeat about the potential for legacy-defining change — 12 years after one of their own, then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), was elected president.

AD

“It’s a moment of leadership for our members of the Congressional Black Caucus,” said Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee (D-Tex.), who is not only hoping for an African American vice presidential nominee but black Cabinet members and Supreme Court nominees in a future Biden administration. “It’s time for us to lead on a national level. . . . It shouldn’t be just one, it has to be many.”

To be sure, the CBC has always been a force to be reckoned with in Congress since its founding in 1971. The organization’s purpose is to use constitutional power and the federal government “to ensure that African Americans and other marginalized communities in the United States have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.”

AD

Now, as the largest minority caucus in the House, it boasts a record membership that is approaching 60 next year.

AD

Its members hold four of the 21 permanent committee gavels. And the group’s highest-ranking member, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), can arguably claim the title of kingmaker after his endorsement in the South Carolina primary propelled former vice president Joe Biden to a statewide victory and the presumptive Democratic presidential nomination.

But the nationwide conversation about race is giving the group even more power and stirring talk about the next leaders. Jackson Lee expressed hope that the policing bill could be one of several pieces of legislation addressing the needs of black Americans. And House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has often been mentioned as a possible first black speaker.

AD

Members took pride Thursday night in securing passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, even though the effort to overhaul law enforcement tactics has stalled in Congress with the Republican-led Senate favoring a narrower measure.

AD

The Democratic bill would ban chokeholds and some no-knock warrants and establish a national database to track police misconduct. In the aftermath of Floyd’s death and nationwide protests, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) deferred to the caucus to craft the legislation, leaning on Bass, its chairwoman, to guide the process.

On Thursday, Jeffries gave an impassioned closing argument for the policing bill, speaking directly to protesters around the nation: “We hear you, we see you, we are you.” He also recounted a story about how his son challenged him after news of Floyd’s death, asking him: “What are you going to do about it?”

AD

“I say to him, and I say to all those other black children throughout America: We are here today as House Democrats to do something about it,” Jeffries said.

AD

When three Republicans — Will Hurd (R-Tex.), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Fred Upton (R-Mich.) — suddenly defected from their leadership instructions to vote “no” and backed the bill, Bass cheered, but bullishly vowed to get more of them to sign on soon.

“I am ecstatic that we have a bipartisan historic passage of a bill to transform policing in the United States,” she said. “And now I look forward to getting my other Republican colleagues on board. Many, many of them came over and approached me. And so, I'm going to celebrate tonight, and I'll be back at work tomorrow.”

On the campaign trail, black politicians have tapped into the energy from the growing demands for racial justice. In primaries this past week, voters spoke when they picked black candidates over their white counterparts, sending a signal of change to Washington.

AD

AD

Beyond Bowman’s probable win in New York, Cameron Webb — an African American physician, former White House fellow and health policy researcher — captured the Democratic nomination in Virginia.

In the New York City suburbs, Mondaire Jones, an attorney and former official in the Obama Justice Department, held a primary lead in a crowded field vying to replace retiring Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.). If he wins, Jones would be the first openly gay black member of Congress.

And in Kentucky’s Democratic Senate primary Charles Booker, once a long-shot candidate, is running close with Amy McGrath, the retired Marine fighter pilot backed by national Democrats. Either one would face a tough challenge in trying to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)

In Congress, the mood has also made CBC members reassess their demands over gavels. Traditionally, the group has been among the most adamant in insisting that House Democrats follow seniority rules, designating the longest serving member as next in line of succession.

AD

AD

Now, caucus members are suggesting diversity should trump seniority, coalescing around Meeks even though Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) is the next likely successor to Engel on Foreign Affairs.

“I don’t want to start measuring drapes, but I think in terms of foreign policy depth, in terms of acumen, in terms of passion, in terms of someone who’s a patriot, in terms of someone who wants to foster greater relationships with the global community, you can’t find a better person than my mentor, big brother and friend Greg Meeks — that’s for sure,” said Rep. André Carson (D-Ind.).

An African American heading the committee, Carson said, would be “monumental” and “historical.” “It’s necessary.”

The committee has passed over Sherman once for the panel’s top Democratic slot in favor of the third-ranking Democrat. In 2012, members objected to how a PAC supporting him sent out a mailer to voters warning that House members Maxine Waters, Barney Frank and Barbara Boxer supported his opponent Howard Berman, who happened to be the panel’s top Democrat. Sherman disavowed the mailing, but Engel got the top post.

Harris (D-Calif.) smiled broadly as she introduced Jill Biden as “our next first lady.” Jill Biden closed her eyes and put her hands over her heart as she recalled how Harris’s op-ed on black maternal health touched her.

The striking show of bonhomie came during a virtual discussion on the Affordable Care Act, which had all the trappings of a typical Biden campaign event. Except this one was freighted with a tense history and effectively doubled as a high-stakes public tryout — the latest in a series featuring a Democrat under consideration to be Biden’s running mate.

To some Biden allies, it also served as a visible turning-of-the-page on an uncomfortable chapter that has loomed over the vice presidential search. Seeking to quell rumblings from some Democrats who have said they detected signs of frustration with Harris from Jill Biden and Valerie Biden Owens, Biden’s sister and longtime political adviser, the Biden campaign on Friday looked to publicly dispel the notion that their views of Harris are anything less than positive.

“Both Dr. Biden and Valerie have nothing but the utmost respect, admiration and affection for Senator Harris,” Biden campaign spokeswoman Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement. “Any rumors or conjecture to the contrary are not true and have zero basis in reality or fact.”

On the debate stage in Miami one year ago Saturday, Harris looked at Biden and told him it was “hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race,” referring to friendly comments he once made about former Senate colleagues.

She accused him of opposing school busing, saying, “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” (Within hours, Harris’s campaign was selling a T-shirt emblazoned with those words.)

Biden shot back that Harris had mischaracterized him. “I did not oppose busing in America,” he said. “What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education.”

For Harris, who has emerged as a top contender to join the Democratic ticket and is the most prominent African American woman under consideration, last summer’s exchange has complicated her prospects in the eyes of some Biden allies. Although some have moved on from it, others said it was not so easy to forget, particularly since Harris was a friend of Biden’s late son, Beau.

“I’m Irish and we Irish hold grudges,” said John Morgan, a Florida trial lawyer and major Biden donor. “It was vicious. It was meant to kill him. And she was probably the one he never would have expected it from, which to me made it more treacherous.”

Other Biden allies said they saw Friday’s joint appearance as a sign of the strides Harris has made.

“It’s etched in my mind,” said Steve Westly, a California investor and top Biden fundraiser, referring to last year’s debate. But he added, “Everybody knows that Jill is in Joe’s inner circle,” and so “the fact that Jill has chosen Kamala to do an event with her double underscores that Kamala is on the very shortlist of people Joe is considering.”

South Carolina state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden friend, said the impact of the 2019 dispute will be determined by Biden alone. “I know that there are people that were not happy with what she tried to do in the debate,” he said, but Biden will decide if it “makes her unacceptable.”

Some aides and associates of Biden and Harris said the tension between the two camps started to recede with the passage of time. As early as one month after the confrontation, Biden greeted Harris on the second debate stage by joking, “Go easy on me, kid.”

In October, Harris, Biden and their aides ran into each other at a private airport terminal after a campaign event in Iowa, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. It was Harris’s birthday, and her husband, Doug Emhoff, gave the Biden team some leftover cupcakes. Harris and Biden had a brief private discussion while their aides talked, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private encounter.

Ian Sams, who served as national press secretary on the Harris campaign, remembered Biden and Harris on other occasions “giving each other hugs backstage or talking about their families or random experiences on the trail.” Sams said his sense of Biden is “you can’t be successful at the highest levels of national politics for 40 years like he has without the rapid ability to turn yesterday’s rivals into today’s allies.”

In recent weeks, Biden frequently has enlisted the help of Harris and other candidates under consideration to be his running mate. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who is being vetted, participated in a call with reporters Friday about the Affordable Care Act. She referred a question about the vetting to the Biden campaign.

Harris has been one of the most active Biden surrogates. The Friday event featured Harris and Jill Biden hearing from supporters in Wisconsin about health care. Together they spoke of the importance of the Affordable Care Act and safeguarding it from GOP efforts to dismantle it. Jill Biden frequently invited Harris to weigh in and offer her perspective.

The discussion got personal, with the participants sharing stories about their health-care experiences. Harris shared the story of her late mother’s battle with cancer. Jill Biden told an emotional story of her sister’s stem-cell transplant, her six-week isolation in a hospital room and the lifesaving help she got from the ACA.

Harris hosted a virtual fundraiser with Biden this month that brought in $3.5 million. Biden offered a word of personal praise for Harris at the event, mentioning her friendship with Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015.

He recalled running into Harris years ago. “You said, ‘I love you and I loved Beau,’ ” Biden said. “I won’t forget that.” Harris said Emhoff had enjoyed spending time with Jill Biden, and they stayed in touch beyond the primaries. On Friday, Jill Biden reflected warmly on her relationship with Emhoff.

In December, on the day Harris ended her campaign, Biden called her, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Harris endorsed Biden on March 8, saying in a video that “he is a man who has lived his life with great dignity.”

But only days earlier, Jill Biden indicated the June 2019 debate had not faded from her mind. On March 6, she was asked at a fundraiser about a potential vice presidential choice. When the discussion turned to Harris, Jill Biden said Harris had a very close “bond” with Beau Biden, and when Biden looked surprised onstage when Harris attacked, it was because “our son Beau spoke so highly of her and, you know, and how great she was.”

AD

AD

She added that she was not saying Harris wasn’t great, but her debate comments were like a “punch to the gut; it was a little unexpected.”

Former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack, a friend of Jill Biden’s, said she does not have any sense of how Jill Biden and Owens feel about Harris.

“I’ve never had that conversation,” she said. Speaking generally of Jill Biden, Vilsack said, “She, like her husband, is a very warm person and she values relationships.”

Questioned on the topic, Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), an ally of both Biden and Harris, said that “politics is not a business for people with thin skin.” She added, “I just don’t believe that in our business you carry hard feelings about something like a debate.”

AD

Some Biden allies pointed to Biden’s relationship with Barack Obama, which Biden has said he is seeking to re-create with his eventual running mate. It, too, had some difficult chapters.

AD

The Rev. Al Sharpton recalled Biden calling him to apologize after playing into black stereotypes when he said of Obama in 2007, “I mean, you got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.”

“That didn’t stop him from being selected,” Sharpton said."/['Sean Sullivan', 'Reporter Covering National Politics', 'Annie Linskey', 'National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JOITUPFX7EI6VKG2NE67HV3HJI.jpg&w=1440"

The vice president dodged the question of whether people should wear masks in public, as his own administration recommends, and said campaign rallies that pack people together, in violation of public health guidance, will continue.

Pence offered no new strategies to combat the rapidly spreading virus and minimized record daily case counts in several states as “outbreaks in specific counties.”

AD

AD

“As we stand here today, all 50 states and territories across the country are opening up, and safely and responsibly,” Pence said, a point that was undermined as Florida and Texas on Friday began to scale back or reverse their reopening plans because of growing outbreaks.

Pence’s remarks came as the virus has emerged as an urgent political crisis for Trump. With less than five months until Election Day, a slate of recent public opinion polls show Trump trailing former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, both nationally and in several key battleground states, with voters taking a negative view of how the administration has handled the pandemic. Some of those states — including Arizona, Florida and Texas — are putting their reopening plans on hold.

The briefing was the latest effort by Pence and Trump to cherry-pick data as they attempt to gloss over the fact that on their watch, the United States has failed to stop the spread of a virus that the White House has often said will soon go away or have less and less impact on daily life.

AD

AD

While Pence acknowledged the rising numbers of cases in the South and the West, he sought to play down the threat while heaping praise on Trump for how he has handled the pandemic. The vice president argued that many of the new cases are being found in younger Americans, who are at less risk of developing deadly complications from the virus than older Americans are. He also argued that states have told him they have enough medical equipment to deal with the surge in infections and repeated the misleading claim that more testing is the main reason for the rising numbers of cases.

Pence rejected the idea that campaign rallies should be curtailed during the pandemic, arguing that the events are constitutionally protected free speech, and he defended two events Trump held in the past week over objections from local officials or the advice of his own public health advisers.

“Well, the freedom of speech, the right to peaceably assemble, is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, and we have an election coming up this fall,” Pence said, adding that people who attend such events are offered screenings and health advice.

AD

In a further sign of worry about the spread of the virus in the United States, Europe is poised to stop allowing American travelers into the European Union as it tries to permit more flights into E.U. member countries.

Trump has pushed for a swift reopening of shuttered businesses and an end to restrictions that have kept most people at home. In recent days he has reiterated that the economy will not be shut down again to contain the virus and has called outbreaks “embers” that can be put out.

Trump did not attend the briefing, which, unlike similar presentations early in the pandemic, was not held at the White House. Those sessions were discontinued as Trump sought to reduce the focus on the pandemic and move on, arguing that the economic toll of restrictions was too high.

AD

The vice president and top federal public health officials spoke on the same day that Florida reported nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases and announced that bars must close immediately, a move echoed in Texas, which is also dealing with a surge in cases and nearing its capacity to care for the infected.

AD

Pence acknowledged that cases have been rising “precipitously” in some states, largely in the South, and announced that he and other task force officials would travel to Texas, Arizona and Florida in the coming days for on-the-ground reports.

He and federal health officials said the onus is on Americans to act responsibly and heed the advice of their local and state leaders, since conditions and risks differ across the nation.

AD

Anthony S. Fauci, who leads the government’s infectious-disease effort, pleaded with Americans to take the virus seriously and continue exercising precautions some four months into a national state of partial paralysis.

“We are all in it together, and the only way we’re going to end it is by ending it together,” Fauci said.

He and other officials wore masks as they flanked Pence, who did not wear one. Fauci and the others removed their masks when speaking at the lectern.

Congressional Republicans have begun to express worries about the rising case numbers even as the White House has sought to downplay them.

AD

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested that nationwide protests against racial injustice were largely responsible for the spike that has led to record-setting numbers of new cases in recent days, despite a lack of evidence supporting such a connection.

AD

Florida’s new-case report blew past the state’s previous single-day record of 5,511, set on Wednesday. It was the 19th day in a row that the state has hit a new average high. Average cases are now up about 77 percent from a week ago and 526 percent since Memorial Day.

The sharp increases are fueling concerns that Florida — where Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has pushed an aggressive reopening strategy — is fast emerging as a new epicenter for the virus.

DeSantis has sought to blame the surging infections on farmworkers, anti-police-brutality protests and an increase in testing, while cheering on the relocation of the Republican National Convention to Florida.

AD

AD

The GOP announced in mid-June that it would relocate the celebratory public portions of its presidential nominating convention to Jacksonville, Fla., from Charlotte after Trump balked at North Carolina’s social distancing requirements.

The move has prompted growing concerns that a convention will only exacerbate the virus’s spread. According to data tracked by The Washington Post, cases in Duval County, which includes Jacksonville, have nearly doubled in the past two weeks.

Meanwhile, less than a day after announcing that Texas would pause reopening plans but not revert to stricter measures, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an executive order that revives restrictions on bars, restaurants and certain types of outdoor recreation.

AD

“The trajectory that we’re on right now has our hospitals being overwhelmed, probably about mid-July,” Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D) said during an appearance on CNN.

AD

Nationwide, infections surpassed 40,000 for the first time Friday, the third national record this week.

Pence said the increases were being driven by people under age 35, which he called “very encouraging news” because they are generally less susceptible to severe illness from the virus.

Other countries are seeing total positive cases going down, regardless of age.

Pence dismissed the idea that premature reopenings by states had contributed to the recent outbreaks. He stressed that while cases have increased, the death rate has declined.

“This moment in the coronavirus pandemic is different than what we saw two months ago,” he said. “It’s almost inarguable that more testing is generating more cases. The volume of new cases is a reflection of the great success in expanding testing across the country.”

AD

Health authorities, however, project that those younger people, many of whom show no symptoms, will probably spread infections to the more vulnerable. They warn of a lag time of about three weeks between when people are diagnosed and subsequent hospitalizations and deaths. They also note that while the death count has declined since the first wave of cases, it is slowly inching up as cases increase again.

Trump told rallygoers in Oklahoma on Saturday that he had asked officials to “slow the testing down, please” so the country would record fewer cases. White House officials have insisted that Trump made the comment in jest, but the president said this week that he wasn’t kidding.

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, and other public health experts have said increased testing alone does not explain the recent increases.

Pence, when pressed by a reporter, declined to recommend that all Americans wear masks as public health officials advise, instead urging people to listen to their local health officials and pray. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, urged everyone to wear a mask.

Trump refuses to wear a mask in public, calling it unpresidential, and the question has become increasingly partisan. Biden said this week that he would like mask-wearing to be mandatory.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized Trump for continuing to seek to kill the Affordable Care Act, even as coronavirus cases rise again, and for failing to model good practices by wearing a mask.

“So when the president of the United States says he doesn’t want to wear a mask and understands the bad example, well, I don’t know if he understands anything, but somebody over there must understand the bad example that is to the country,” she said."/['Anne Gearan', 'White House Reporter', 'Yasmeen Abutaleb', 'National Reporter Focusing On Health Policy']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DUFZZWVX3II6VJIQKW7SMSC4SM.jpg&w=1440"

For Trump allies, going barefaced is all about individual liberty. For Biden supporters, the mask is a symbol of science and sound policy.

But as infections spike in red states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, support for masks has grown. In recent days, even some Republicans have urged the public to cover their faces in public, arguing that it’s the best way to slow the virus. This shift in rhetoric highlights the potential risks for the president as he continues to ignore the advice of public health experts, who agree that masks are crucial to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

“It does go to character and values,” Democratic pollster Joel Benenson said. “Biden is known for being decent, for caring about the country, a middle-class guy, working with people on the other side. Trump is the antithesis of that. So the more Trump tries to attack Biden over petty smaller things, the smaller it makes Trump look.”

Polling suggests that the majority of Americans favor facial coverings.

More than 70 percent of Americans believe that people should wear masks most or all of the time in public places, according to a Pew Research survey from mid-June.

A Fox News poll from last week found that 80 percent hold a favorable view of those who wear masks, including 68 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of respondents who strongly approve of Trump.

AD

Some Republican leaders have echoed those favorable views.

AD

“Until we find a vaccine, [masks] are really important,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky on Friday. “This is not as complicated as a ventilator. This is a way to indicate that you want to protect others. We all need during this period, until we find a vaccine, to think of us as protecting not only ourselves but others.”

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-highest-ranking House Republican, endorsed facial coverings Friday with a photo of her father in a cowboy hat and blue disposable mask.

The caption read: “Dick Cheney says WEAR A MASK. #realmenwearmasks.”

AD

Also Friday, former Trump defense secretary Jim Mattis, who has been publicly critical of the president since leaving the job in 2018, starred in a public service announcement in his hometown of Richland, Wash., urging people to wear masks.

AD

“Hello, neighbors. I’m Jim Mattis,” he says in a video posted to the town’s YouTube page. “I’m here to talk about that nasty little virus, covid. . . . It’s clear this little bugger isn’t going away on its own.”

“Wear those face coverings,” Mattis said, “and let’s work together on this to beat covid.”

Many local Republican leaders have echoed that message as infections spike in red states. “Protect yourself. Protect others. Help contain the spread of Covid-19. Wear a mask,” Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) wrote in a social media post.

AD

“Everyone should just wear a . . . mask,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said. The Sunshine State had nearly 9,000 new infections Thursday, a record.

Even so, Trump and his allies have steadfastly refused to wear face coverings, even as the president has ramped up his travel schedule in the past few weeks.

AD

At the Friday press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force, the first in two months, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, and Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease doctor, all wore masks.

Pence did not.

When asked whether he had a message to the nation about “the importance of wearing masks,” Pence said only that people should listen to the guidance from their state or local officials.

AD

Analysts say Trump’s position is designed to appeal to his core voters. “Trump’s gut instinct is to play to his base,” Republican pollster Ed Goeas said.

But Goeas said the strategy is misguided. Trump’s resistance to mask-wearing focuses the conversation on his polarizing persona, Goeas said, rather than on policy issues where the president can find broader support.

AD

But Trump has suggested that he sees wearing one as a critique of his leadership, telling the Wall Street Journal that “it could be” that people put them on to make a political statement against him.

In the same interview, Trump said that wearing a mask can have negative effects. “They drop it on the desk and then they touch their eye and they touch their nose,” Trump said. “I think a mask is a — it’s a double-edged sword.”

AD

A spokesman for Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Trump and his allies have turned to social media to mock Biden for covering his face, retweeting a message from Fox News’s Brit Hume, who posted a photo with Biden wearing a mask and adding the caption: “This might explain why Trump doesn’t wear a mask. Biden today.”

But Democrats see Biden’s face covering as an advantage.

AD

“Biden wants to lead by example,” said Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist who briefly led the Democratic National Committee.

“He is sending the right signal to the public,” said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), who participated in a raucous hearing Friday where some Republicans refused to cover their faces.

AD

“This is all we’ve got” to contain the virus, he added.

The partisan fight over mask-wearing spilled over onto Capitol Hill on Friday, during a hearing of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, because Democrats wore masks and some Republicans did not.

At one point, Raskin accused Republican members who were maskless of provoking “terror and fear in your colleagues and perhaps your staff.”

Raskin criticized Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) in particular, who is known for going jacketless, saying that going without a jacket is “a fashion statement,” but not wearing a mask is a “public health menace.”

AD

Republicans, several of whom had worn masks into the hearing room before taking them off, contended that they could practice social distancing safely while seated maskless at the dais.

AD

“We are six feet apart. We don’t need a mask,” said Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.), a physician.

House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) threatened to end the practice of holding in-person hearings — something Republicans have demanded — if they don’t wear masks.

The president’s posture comes as he has sought to energize his conservative political base in response to polls that show diminishing public approval over his handling of both the racial justice protests and the coronavirus pandemic. After framing his police executive action as an effort to balance the interests of victims’ families and police officers, Trump has sided squarely with the law enforcement community, reinforcing widespread skepticism about his commitment to addressing complaints of racial bias and systemic abuses in police departments that have harmed African Americans.

AD

AD

“There are certain things I’ve accepted about Donald Trump,” said Lee Merritt, the attorney for more than half a dozen black families that met with the president at the White House ahead of his Rose Garden announcement. “Part of it is that he is always going to favor his base, which is law enforcement and law enforcement-aligned individuals.”

Amid the nationwide debate that erupted after George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis last month, Merritt added, Trump “needed to be involved in that conversation, but it goes contrary to everything he’s said before with regard to policing.”

White House aides insisted that Trump has not given up on the executive actions he outlined to establish federal certification standards on police training, create a national database to track police abuse cases and pair law enforcement agencies with social workers when responding in communities.

AD

AD

The administration has been coordinating with Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who is leading the Senate GOP’s legislative proposals, although that effort has clashed with a competing package from House Democrats that includes more expansive police changes.

Ja’Ron Smith, a White House domestic policy aide, said on Fox Business this week that Trump was right to threaten protesters who have torn down monuments because “we’ve got to have a civil conversation and a civil society and a nation of laws. . . . This right here is lawlessness and anarchy, and it doesn’t represent the people in the community.”

Smith, who helped develop Trump’s executive actions along with senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, said that the administration “will do all we can do administratively,” including using convening power to “bring both sides together.”

AD

AD

Trump aides said the president has expressed support for peaceful protesters and empathy for Floyd on multiple occasions, but the most recent example in a list provided by the White House was June 5.

Over the past 11 days, Trump has lashed out against demonstrators repeatedly, and he changed a photo on his Twitter profile to one of him posing with 33 uniformed police officers in front of Air Force One.

Ahead of a campaign rally in Tulsa last weekend, he suggested in a tweet that “Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes” would be treated more strictly in the Republican-led city than in New York, Seattle or Minneapolis, jurisdictions run by Democrats.

AD

He slammed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to have artists paint “Black Lives Matter” in front of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, saying New York police “are furious.”

AD

And after police thwarted an attempt to topple the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square next to the White House last Monday, Trump declared that “numerous people are in jail and going to jail today.” He also said he had authorized 10-year prison terms for “these vandals and these hoodlums and these anarchists and these agitators.”

Yet in his eagerness to project toughness, Trump exaggerated the state of affairs. In fact, authorities made a combined four arrests that day — none in direct connection with damaging the Jackson statue.

AD

D.C. police arrested two men accused of spraying officers with a fire extinguisher. And U.S. Park Police arrested two others who allegedly punched officers during skirmishes as the federal officers sought to clear the area of protesters. But the U.S. attorney’s office in the District, led by a Trump appointee, did not pursue criminal charges against the latter two men.

AD

“The last time I checked, the executive branch doesn’t make law,” said attorney Paul L. Goldstone, who represents them. “President Trump can tweet all he wants about ‘lock them up,’ but the reality is he doesn’t make the criminal code. Someone needs to teach him a constitutional lesson.”

In a town hall-style event with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, Trump asserted that federal authorities had made hundreds of arrests since the protests began. In fact, authorities have charged about 125 people with federal crimes, according to a Justice Department tally released Friday afternoon.

AD

Trump cited a recent spate of community violence in Chicago and told Hannity that city is more dangerous than Afghanistan. He said living in Baltimore; Oakland, Calif.; and Detroit is “like living in hell.”

And he touted the “stop-and-frisk” policing policies established two decades ago in New York City by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, now Trump’s personal lawyer. Liberals denounced those policies, which were ended in 2014, as unfairly targeting black residents, and Mike Bloomberg, who succeeded Giuliani, apologized during his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination this year for having expanded the program.

AD

“President Trump will always stand for law and order — which is the only way to ensure peace on our streets,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said in a statement. She accused Democrats of “calling for defunding our brave police officers, caving to mob rule, and promoting cancel culture which seeks to erase our history. The president speaks for Americans who want safety and security to prevail.”

AD

Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said he believes Trump has tried to strike a balance on police reform. Cosme was among a handful of law enforcement officials who stood next to Trump in the Rose Garden when he signed the executive order in mid-June. The officials also attended the private meeting that day between the president and the black families represented by Merritt.

“I was like, ‘Wow, I saw a different side of the president,’” Cosme said. “He was sympathetic to these folks. He listened.”

AD

Cosme said his organization, which is nonpolitical, supports peaceful protests, “but you have to follow the law.” However, the scenes of violence have frightened law-abiding demonstrators, he added.

AD

“Overall, the message that all politicians should be putting out is the safety for the American public number one, along with being sympathetic to folks who feel victimized,” Cosme said.

Merritt confirmed Trump appeared sympathetic in private, and he said the president instructed Attorney General William P. Barr to determine if federal intervention was necessary in their cases. Merritt said he maintains hope that Trump will ultimately support broader legislative reforms, citing his efforts to help push a criminal justice reform bill through Congress in 2018.

“That’s a possibility, although it’s unlikely,” Merritt said. If not, Trump and his aides “would then be exposed for being hypocritical and being liars and taking advantage of those most affected by police brutality by taking a meeting just to say he met with them. That would be more politically dangerous than he knows.”

The headline of an opinion piece published in an Israeli newspaper by Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador to the United States, read: “It’s Either Annexation or Normalization.”

To many Palestinians, the pushback coming from Arab countries is welcome, especially to those who have detected a degree of fatigue and silence from their neighbors in recent years as countries have focused less on the conflict and more on quietly improving ties with Israel.

“I’m definitely pleased they are saying something, because there have been years when they said nothing,” said Diana Buttu, an activist and former negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization now living in Haifa.

But it remains to be seen whether Arab leaders will go beyond mere statements of solidarity for Palestinians and take concrete measures in the event of annexation, Palestinians and regional analysts say. Pressure from the streets to do so could be limited, as Arabs across the region are distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, economic instability, civil wars and other woes.

Additionally, the gradual warming of relations between the Jewish state and its neighbors is based on common goals — containing Iranian expansionism, countering extremist movements — that will probably remain priorities regardless of Israel’s actions in the West Bank.

“I have no faith in the statements they are making,” added Buttu, referring to Arab leaders. “The rapprochement is on the level of governments where their interests are the same.”

The West Bank, which the Jewish state has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war, is home to as many as 3 million Palestinians and roughly 430,000 Israeli Jews living in scores of settlements. The United Nations and most European countries consider the settlements illegal, but Israel and the Trump administration dispute this.

It’s unclear how much land would be annexed, should it happen. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed last year to annex the Jordan Valley, a swath along the West Bank’s boundary with Jordan, as well as areas containing Israeli settlements. This year, Netanyahu said as much as 30 percent could be annexed.

But Israeli media reports have suggested that any takeover could be 5 percent or less of the land, depending on what’s approved by the United States. Annexation is linked to a plan by the Trump administration for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — and the Arab condemnations have raised concerns about alienating key U.S. allies in the region.

Such denunciations didn’t occur after other steps recently taken to benefit Israel to Arabs’ detriment. When the United States last year recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, territory seized from Syria in 1967, Arab leaders were critical but took no concrete measures. That was also the case when the Trump Administration relocated the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, after recognizing it as Israel’s capital.

“Israel enjoys a less hostile Arab world, a friendlier Arab world and an Arab world that seeks Israel’s help with broader geostrategic interests in the region,” said Amaney Jamal, a Princeton professor and co-founder of the Arab Barometer, which gauges public opinion in the Middle East. “So why is Israel not saying, ‘Let us maintain this new era of ties, friendships and alliances and resolve the Palestinian issue’? It’s in Israel’s strategic interest, but Israel is calculating that it doesn’t need to.”

So far, Jordan has been the most outspoken in its opposition to the annexation plans. With its close ties to the United States and Israel, it’s also the most influential Arab country in changing Israel’s mind, analysts say.

AD

AD

Netanyahu and his loyalists have argued that the response by Arab governments to annexation is likely to be muted because of the interests they share with Israel in security, trade, technology and opposition to Iran.

But Otaiba, the ambassador, said in his opinion piece that “annexation will certainly and immediately upend Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and with [the United Arab Emirates].”

He added that annexation would “harden Arab views of Israel.” That, analysts said, could trigger populist anger at Arab leaders’ growing rapprochement with Israel.

“If the Palestinians themselves eventually begin to organize, they are likely to draw lots of support from younger Arabs in other countries, who might well challenge their governments’ ties with Israel,” said Michelle Dunne, head of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in an email.

AD

AD

Arab leaders, she added, are aware that with Israel’s occupation, “a de facto Israeli annexation of the West Bank” has been ongoing for decades. But hopes for a two-state solution — an independent Palestinian state coexisting with Israel — were always there. Annexation would undermine the legitimacy of the Palestinian leadership and spell the end of a two-state solution, Arab leaders, the U.N. and Western officials say.

“Once it is clear that there is no longer any realistic chance of a viable, sovereign state of Palestine being created, it becomes more difficult for Arab leaders to justify publicly their plans to further develop strategic cooperation with Israel,” Dunne said.

AD

Many Palestinians, though, remain skeptical about neighboring governments and their intentions.

AD

“I don’t think Israel gives a damn for the Arab position, except Jordan because of the sensitivity of its relations with Israel and the United States,” said Ghassan Khatib, a former spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority. “So whether the Arabs are divided or united, whether they oppose or not oppose, I don’t believe this is one of the major factors Israel will take into consideration when deciding to annex or not.”

Buttu blames Arab diplomats for framing the steady encroachment of Israel into the West Bank as a threat to improving ties and regional stability rather than a violation of basic human rights.

AD

“That’s misguided,” Buttu said. “You don’t oppose it just because it could lead to instability and violence. You oppose it because it’s illegal and it’s wrong for the Palestinian people.”

AD

Buttu said Israel’s de facto annexation will continue even if Israel pulls back from formally extending its control over the settlements."/['Sudarsan Raghavan', 'Cairo Bureau Chief Covering North Africa', 'Steve Hendrix', 'Jerusalem Bureau Chief Steve Hendrix Has Reported Many Countries', 'Most States Since Joining The Post In']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/46PWGLVX5AI6VLFF5O3D2J7B74.jpg&w=1440"

In wide-ranging goods such as cars, cellphones and medicine, Chinese components are a crucial part of Indian supply chains. Even bulletproof vests used by Indian soldiers are made with material imported from China.

India’s economic relationship with China was in the spotlight even before the June 15 clash high in the Himalayas. The pandemic had already prompted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to launch a high-profile campaign for “self-reliance” — aatmanirbharta in Hindi — in which he urged Indians to buy local.



AD

AD

Reducing India’s reliance on China won’t be easy. The economic relationship between the two countries, like the military one, is asymmetrical. China is India’s second-largest overall trading partner and its biggest source of imports. India, by contrast, does not figure in China’s top 15 trading partners and is even lower on the list of sources of imports.

An economic boycott by India of Chinese products would not even “amount to a decent slap,” said Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi who has researched China’s global trade ties.

Meanwhile, the situation at the disputed border between the two countries remains precarious, with troop buildups on both sides. Talks to ease the tensions are underway at the military and diplomatic levels; earlier this week, the Indian army said there was a “mutual consensus to disengage” from “all friction areas.” China said the two sides had agreed to “lower the temperature.”

But neither country provided any details and they continued to condemn each other for instigating the violence. Some analysis of satellite imagery suggests that China has not retreated from its positions near where the deadly clash took place in the Galwan valley, but rather fortified them. (China has said that there were “casualties” in the conflict but has not confirmed how many of its soldiers were injured or killed.)

Experts say the clash — the most serious between the two countries in more than 50 years — marks a turning point. “There’s no trust right now,” said Tanvi Madan, the director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution. “Nobody is going to buy this idea anymore that greater economic engagement is going to alleviate political strains” between the two countries.

AD

AD

Even as India faces a grim economic outlook, Modi has elaborated on his goal of self-reliance. “India will reduce its dependence on imports,” he said three days after the clash with China. Self-reliance also means that “we become [the] biggest exporters of the commodities that we now import,” Modi said.

Now there are signals that India is preparing to make it harder for Chinese firms to do business in the country. In recent days, e-commerce platforms have been told to label their products with the country of origin, Bloomberg News reported this week; a government procurement site has told sellers to do the same thing. Both steps are viewed as attempts to reduce imports of Chinese goods.

In April, the Indian government announced that it would review all foreign direct investments by Chinese companies rather than allow them to proceed through an automatic route.

AD

AD

One important test of India’s shifting stance will come in the telecom industry. Nearly 40 percent of India’s electronic-equipment imports come from China, while Chinese brands dominate the smartphone arena, capturing 72 percent of the market last year. India is among those countries mulling whether to allow China’s Huawei Technologies to build its next-generation 5G mobile networks, something that now looks highly unlikely.

Another striking example of China’s role in Indian supply chains came in the days after the Galwan clash. S.C. Kansal, managing director of SMPP, a firm that was awarded a major contract to make more than 100,000 bulletproof jackets for the Indian army in 2018, told the Indian Express newspaper that the company was reliant on imports of materials from China to make its products.

The company “will move with the mood of the country,” Kansal added. “If required, we will look at alternative routes.” Kansal declined to respond to further questions.

Mohinder Kumar Gupta is the managing director of Star Wire, an Indian firm that makes bulletproof vests for Indian paramilitary and police forces. His company, too, sources a raw material for its products — high performance polyethylene — from China. A similar input is available from Europe or the United States, albeit at a higher price.

AD

AD

His company uses Chinese suppliers “only for economic reasons,” Gupta said. If the government tells the firm to do otherwise, it will shift its approach. “We’re all very keen” to do so, he said.

India’s pharmaceutical sector, a major player in the global generic drug industry, is also deeply dependent on China. About 70 percent of the active ingredients used by drugmakers comes from China, according to Ashok Kumar Madan, executive director of the Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association. Long before the conflict, India was looking to decrease that reliance, but there is no easy or quick route to achieve that goal.

To make the active ingredients, you need the starting materials, Madan said. And “that is an arena where, again, you have to look to China.”

AD

For some trade experts, India’s heightened attention to its dependence on China is overdue. Biswajit Dhar, a former Indian trade negotiator, said that even as the economic relationship between the two countries has expanded over the past decade, he sees a troubling trend.

AD

The economic exchanges between India and China remind him of colonial-era patterns of trade, Dhar said, where India largely exported raw materials while importing higher-value intermediate and final products. “If you consider the division of labor, then China is certainly on the winning side,” he said.

Especially in two key areas — telecoms and pharmaceuticals — the government “must put in place a medium-term strategy to get out of this kind of dependence” on China, Dhar said. It is “absolutely imperative.”

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/27/how-worlds-beaches-are-readying-summer-social-distancing/"/How the world’s beaches are readying for a summer of social distancing/"But while the novel coronavirus may dislike direct sun and open air, it loves a crowd and shared spaces. That’s why officials in southern England were so shocked last week by what they classed as a “major incident” amid a heat wave: thousands of people packing beaches, all in violation of social distancing measures. In Brazil, beachgoers have similarly flocked to sandy shores while flouting face mask recommendations.

From “beach bubbles” to drones to sensors and cellphone tracking, here’s how some countries are readying their beaches for a summer of social distancing.

Greece

Greece’s picturesque sandy seasides have long been an alluring summer destination. But this year, the Mediterranean country has a new attraction: a low coronavirus count and, as a of mid-June, borders open to some foreign tourists.

AD

AD

Greece also wants to keep it that way, despite the risk of a resurgence posed by letting in travelers. So the government has devised a plan for mandating disinfectants and maintaining physical distances since it began to reopen beaches in mid-May, with updates since. Under current regulations, only up to 40 people will be permitted per every 1,000 square meters of beach, or about a quarter acre. A maximum of two chairs can be under each umbrella, which must be placed at least 13 feet from another. (An exemption is made for families, who are allowed to be in proximity to one other as a group.)

Beachgoers are supposed to place a towel on their chair, which staff are required to sanitize after every use. To further discourage crowds, beach-based restaurants were initially allowed to serve only takeaway meals, and no alcohol, to people waiting at least five feet apart while in line.

Beachgoers who violate these rules can face a fine from the police of up to $1,120, according to the BBC.

Belgium

Cellphone tracking and sensors will be deployed to keep Belgium’s seaside resorts and beaches less crowded this summer, Reuters reported.

AD

AD

Beaches are allowed to open as of Saturday, and the government has devised a tracking system aimed at rerouting residents and tourists to less-populated areas. Using cellphone data and 130 sensors stationed around towns, authorities will be updating a public website sharing in real-time that areas are more or less crowded. Dark green will indicate an area is calm, while orange will denote high density, according to the Reuters news agency.

Some local governments have devised their own designs. In the town of Knokke-Heist, tourism council member Anthony Wittesaele came up with “beach bubbles” — or markings in the sand to indicate 32-square-foot boxes, or about the size of a medium-size carpet.

“We have implemented what we call ‘beach bubbles,’ where one family or friends can be together in a safe way and to visualize the distance that they should be from one another,” he told Reuters.

Dubai

The financial center of the United Arab Emirates is beginning to reopen, months after its upscale malls and lavish hotels shut down. During scorching summer days, much of life in the Emirates happens in the air-conditioned indoors, which now poses a problem for coronavirus infection-control.

AD

AD

But in public, the politically restrictive city-state is trying to enforce its new beach protocol. Dubai has made mask-wearing at the beach mandatory and banned groups of more than five. Masks while in the water, though, are not required. (Masks in general are required in public, except in some instances like strenuous exercise.)

Between May 29, when beaches reopened, and June 7 the government reported that 316 people were penalized for violating the rules, according to the Abu Dhabi-based the National newspaper. On just one Friday in early June, police cited 221 offenders. The fine for violating face mask-wearing and social-distancing rules is more than $800.

Police told the National they have also made use of drones to zone in on rule breakers.

Thailand

Thailand still remains closed to international travelers, so its beloved beaches have fewer crowds and possible pitfalls to worry about.

AD

AD

In the meantime, mask-clad workers at the entrance of beachside venues screen and count everyone entering to keep a low capacity. In the coastal city of Pattaya, beachgoers are required to stay around three feet apart. Residents told the South China Morning Post that they had never seen the water so clean or sand so empty.

Like many Southeast Asian countries, Thailand’s confirmed coronavirus count remains comparatively low to other European or Latin American countries. But it has still taken the virus seriously. Some beaches reopened only on June 1. And after kick-starting local tourism, the government is considering travel corridors with China and Japan, among others, Bloomberg News reported.

Spain

Drones are also buzzing above the carefully monitored beaches of Lloret de Mar, a resort town in northeastern Spain.

AD

AD

Spain is readying for the return of foreign travelers after curbing its initial coronavirus outbreak, which killed more than 28,300 people. “The way we go to the beach this year has changed but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy it,” urged a promotional video for one resort very popular with British tourists, AFP reported.

At Lloret de Mar, sensors are also in place to alert the municipality when an area’s capacity has been reached. Visitors can then access this information via a designated app, according to AFP.

So far, crowding hasn’t been an issue. But Lloret de Mar is prepared for all kinds of beach conditions. The local government has additionally devised plans for cordoning off sections based on age, such as designating special areas for the elderly, families with children, and groups without kids.

France

In May, France initially reopened its beaches to short-term exercising but banned most other activities. That prompted one resort to experiment with social-distancing compliant sunbathing, The Washington Post reported. The resort town of La Grande Motte near Montpelier roped off 75 squares to keep people separated. The municipality’s website then offered beachgoers the chance to reserve a three-hour spot up to two days in advance. Openings quickly filled up.

But as it reopens to visitors, will it lose that status?/"SAN FELE, Italy — The mountaintop town is four hours south of Rome, reachable by switchback roads — appropriately remote for an alternate reality. Here, far away from the coronavirus pandemic, in a place where nobody has tested positive or gotten sick, it was lunchtime, and a restaurant in town was filling up: tables of four, tables of six, a table of eight, and then the biggest table of all, reserved for teachers and middle schoolers celebrating graduation.

The teenagers had taken their final exams online — per national rules — but this was San Fele, so they were able to push through the restaurant doors, laughing, eating in a hurry, trading seats, no masks in sight. The teachers weren’t wearing masks either. Nor the mayor, sitting at another table. Nor the live musicians, who started belting out tunes in the kind of celebration that could only happen in a place where nobody was deemed a threat.

“It’s almost normal,” said Elisabetta Chieca, 37, a city councilor, sitting at a nearby table where the mayor was fighting to speak over the din.

“All locals here,” said Donato Sperduto, the mayor. “Everybody knows everybody.”

With some combination of geographic isolation, initial precautions and good fortune, the town of San Fele never even had a coronavirus curve to flatten — and it now has the enviable chance to ride out the pandemic as a New Zealand-like oasis, free from the virus’s dangers and disruptions.

But like other places around the world that have managed to control or prevent outbreaks, from island nations to nursing homes, there is recognition here that coronavirus-free status is a precarious state. At any moment, somebody with the virus could come up the switchback roads.

“Our fear,” Sperduto said, “is those who come from the outside.”

San Fele survives economically by pitching itself as a weekend tourism destination. Before the pandemic, on many summer Sundays, dozens of tour buses from other parts of Italy would pull up, in what amounted to a momentary doubling of the town’s population. Visitors would stroll through the city center. They’d buy ricotta at a local farm. After hikes to see the nearby forest and waterfalls, they’d stop at the very restaurant where the mayor was now talking about how to navigate Italy’s reopening.

“We can’t rest easy,” he said, as the server brought out pasta topped with truffles, then roast lamb.

So after lunch, the mayor took the three newest arrivals in town — two reporters and a photographer — back into the city center, where the stone streets were too narrow for cars. He led the way around the corner and walked up the steps to the office of one of San Fele’s two doctors.

“Ciao, Michele,” Sperduto said.

The door opened, and a nurse spread out three coronavirus antibody tests, a batch of which the mayor had ordered for the town at the beginning of Italy’s outbreak.

“As soon as somebody arrives, we’ll try to test them,” Sperduto said. “Of course, it’s all based on being aware of who visits.”

A nurse, with a prick, drew blood samples from three fingertips. A couple of minutes later, the results were back.

The town was still coronavirus-free.

From the highest point in San Fele, one can see the signs of decay common in so many Italian hilltop towns — places built for medieval defense, but less practical for the modern world.

The town, over the past century and a half, saw its population get halved and then halved again, to 2,800. Most of the youth left for college or jobs, returning only as visitors to see their elderly parents.

The town center has become a hollowed husk, 30 percent occupied, beautiful but crumbling. Weeds twist through some of the sidewalks and walls. A couple of front doors are padlocked. Some of the windows are knocked out. One resident, leading a short tour down the street where she lived, pointed to the houses all around her.

“That one is empty,” Angela Verducci, 65, said. “That one is empty. They’ll be tearing that one down because the roof collapsed.”

Because those who remain in San Fele are largely older — it has an estimated 15 centenarians, and many more in their 90s — officials had worried at the outset of the pandemic that the town might be in for a disaster. While outbreaks raged in Italy’s north, experts warned about what could lie ahead for Italy’s poorer south, given its dearth of hospital intensive care beds and medical resources.

So San Fele took precautions in every way it could. It barred people from entering the pharmacy and instituted home deliveries for prescriptions. It administered coronavirus tests to volunteers, police officers, trash collectors — anybody having contact with others. Meanwhile, a nationwide lockdown halted most movement, and saved the south from a calamity of the scale experienced in the north.

San Fele’s region — Basilicata, the obscure instep of Italy’s boot — has had only 401 coronavirus cases, and only two in the last month.

At least one was a person who entered the region from the outside.

In retrospect, the mayor said, San Fele felt most secure during the lockdown. People were anxious, but almost nobody was arriving in town.

Italy loosened restrictions on inter-regional travel June 3. Now it is opening up to travelers from across Europe. Many of the people who grew up in San Fele and moved away now have the chance, at last, to come back.

And gradually, that is what is happening.

The mayor’s eldest daughter, 26, who lives in the northern city of Turin, recently made plans for a return visit. A man from Milan showed up in town on a recent weekend, wearing an N95 mask, to check in on his mother.

“Most of my family — grandfather, brothers, cousins — all left,” said Vito Ricigliano, 72, who then mentioned that a cousin who lives in Rome was also returning to San Fele later that day.

“We grew up together,” he said. “We trust one another. But anything is possible. When I go visit him, I’ll wear a mask.”

Several hours later, Ricigliano was knocking on the door of his cousin, who was still unpacking and cleaning up. The cousin, Michele Maselli, 72, moved away from San Fele at age 14 and said the place was “dying,” but he came back every summer — for the “tranquility,” and because it was home.

Maselli mentioned that, when he arrived in town, somebody stopped him and asked why he was wearing a mask.

He was taken aback.

“Out of respect,” he replied. He didn’t consider himself high-risk — there weren’t many new daily cases in Rome and he and his wife had driven directly to town. Still, it seemed the right thing to do.

“Here,” Ricigliano said with a laugh, “you are the threat.”

The new arrivals had no duty to inform the town they were coming, and so they hadn’t yet been tested. Meanwhile, the town had no chance to test people who were just passing through.

The following day, around 10 a.m., the first tour bus of the season pulled up to a parking lot at the base of the town. It brought a group of 23 people from across Italy’s south. They had started the morning in Matera, one hour away. They got off the bus here wearing backpacks and sneakers, holding walking sticks. Most had masks.

For the next three hours, they trekked through the town center and into the surrounding forest, on trails crowded with day-trippers. They took photos at the waterfalls. At lunchtime, they made their way to the restaurant.

It was even more packed than it had been a few days earlier. Big families, with children and grandparents, were there for their Sunday meals. One teenager, with balloons at his table, was celebrating a birthday.

A server pushed several tables together. The group of 23 out-of-towners sat down.

E.U. countries were among the world’s hardest-hit by the pandemic this spring, but most now have the virus under control and have been willing to consider opening their borders to other countries where the novel coronavirus is similarly in check.

China is among the 15 countries set to make the cut, despite E.U. skepticism about how transparent it has been about its outbreak. Visitors from China would be allowed to enter Europe only if Beijing drops measures against E.U. travelers.

Also expected to be approved: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. The list is subject to final approval Saturday, but diplomats said it was unlikely to change. The rest of the world would continue to be kept out for nonessential travel.

The decision underscores the perception here that the United States has failed in its coronavirus response. European leaders and health experts have watched with unease as many American states insist on reopening, even as infections spike in many parts of the country.

E.U. members have seen clusters of infections since they began relaxing their own restrictions. Germany, Spain and Portugal are among those that have reimposed localized lockdowns. But for the bloc as a whole, diagnoses have slowed to 16 cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, the main measure Europe is using to determine whether countries make the cut.

AD

AD

The United States, by contrast, stands at 122 cases per 100,000 people, and numbers are getting worse. Florida has set records for the past 19 days in a row.

Wary of being pulled into a diplomatic brawl with each country they continue to exclude, European leaders have strained to keep their internal discussions focused narrowly on issues of science and epidemiology.

“The European Union has an internal process to determine from which countries it would be safe to accept travelers,” Eric Mamer, a spokesman for the European Commission, told reporters Thursday as the discussions were underway. “Our internal process is related, obviously, to considerations based on health criteria.”

AD

But there are clear political pressures.

Continuing the ban on travel from Russia will exacerbate diplomatic tensions with an already volatile neighbor. Extending restrictions on travel from the United States will strain Europe’s most important geopolitical relationship, even if it was President Trump who moved first to block European travelers in March.

AD

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday acknowledged the desire in Washington to open up the world for travel again.

“We’re all taking seriously the need to figure out how to get this open. We need to get our global economy back going again,” he said in an online discussion hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “We’ll work closely with our European friends, broadly, because I know there’s different views, again, inside the European Union.” He cited “a dozen or more” countries that were interested in opening up to Americans, without naming any of them.

AD

The E.U. list is a recommendation, not a requirement, because each E.U. nation retains sovereign control over its borders. But E.U. members have strong incentives to go along with the decision, since, if they do not, the gradual process of restoring border-free travel within Europe could be placed on hold or reversed, diplomats said. The E.U. plans to review its list of acceptable countries every two weeks.

AD

European diplomats, gathering in person in a Brussels conference room, negotiated for hours in multiple meetings in recent days. The blandly technocratic discussions masked the human drama caused by the travel disruptions. Couples have been stuck on opposite sides of the Atlantic for months. Business negotiations are on hold. Long-dreamed-of vacations have been delayed. Europe’s airports, once bustling connectors for the world, have been eerily quiet. In Brussels, the airport usually has 300 flights a day. It expected 435 for all of next week, according to a spokeswoman.

People fell into two camps during the discussions, according to diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about the closed-door negotiations. Those from poorer, tourist-dependent southern European nations — led by Greece and Portugal — favored approving more countries, hoping to salvage at least a scrap of their fast-dwindling summer season. Other E.U. nations, especially in the richer north, wanted to proceed more cautiously.

AD

The talks were further complicated by the fact that European caseloads vary widely. Sweden, the worst-off in Europe, reported 155 cases per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks. Portugal, the second-worst, stood at 44. Britain, which is no longer a member of the E.U. but until the end of the year is subject to many E.U. decisions, was third at 24.

AD

The diplomats debated which outside countries’ public health numbers they could trust. There was extensive back-and-forth about China, which has been reporting lower infection rates than the E.U. and which has imposed travel restrictions on some E.U. countries but not others.

The E.U. plans to consult with its delegations on the ground to decide how much stock to put in each country’s official figures.

AD

Negotiators also had to make judgment calls about countries that are trending worse, even though their overall infection levels remain relatively decent.

Much of the talks focused on where, precisely, to draw the line for the list. Turkey, Canada and Egypt all had backers and detractors, the diplomats said, since they have slightly worse infection rates than the E.U. Ukraine was on the list, then dropped off. Tiny Georgia, a country of 3.7 million people, steadfastly remained.

Several hours after the attack, García Harfuch wrote on Twitter that one of Mexico’s largest drug cartels, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known by its Spanish acronym, CJNG, was responsible for the attack.

“This morning we were cowardly attacked by the CJNG, two colleagues and friends of mine lost their life, I have three bullet wounds and several shards,” he wrote. “Our Nation must continue to confront the cowardly organized crime. We will continue working.”

The Jalisco cartel has risen to prominence since splitting off from the Sinaloa Cartel around 2010. It has gained territorial control over much of Mexico and has violently clashed with other cartels during that expansion. But it has seldom attempted to assassinate high-level Mexican officials.

The United States has actively targeted members of the cartel, arresting hundreds of people associated with the group and extraditing others.

At 38, García Harfuch is among the youngest people ever to ascend to the top of Mexico City’s security apparatus. Many see him as a promising leader, willing to take on the country’s growing problem of narco-violence.

On Friday afternoon, the Mexico City attorney general’s office interrogated suspects. In a statement, Attorney General Ernestina Godoy Ramos said detainees admitted that a total of 28 gunmen were recruited about three weeks ago and were promised cash in exchange for their participation.

After the attack, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador suggested that it was García Harfuch’s willingness to take on organized crime that made him a target.

“It has to do, without a doubt, with the work that is being carried out to guarantee peace and tranquility both in Mexico City and in the country,” López Obrador said at a morning news conference.

Earlier this week, six police officers were ambushed and killed in the state of Guerrero. Last weekend, 12 people were killed in the state of Sonora during what officials described as a clash between two rival criminal groups.

Tönnies, whose hulking factory sits just a few miles down the road, is Europe’s largest slaughterhouse — and the site of a coronavirus outbreak that triggered Germany’s first snapback in restrictions. More than 1,500 workers have tested positive, contributing to a sharp rise in the country’s overall virus reproduction rate and forcing more than half a million people into a semi-lockdown.

AD

AD

The meat-processing industry has emerged as the Achilles’ heel of Germany’s otherwise widely praised coronavirus response.

Processing plants are thought to be especially conducive to viral spread, with their cold temperatures, limited ventilation and people close together shouting to one another over all the noise. Abattoirs from the United States to the Netherlands have been forced to close their doors because of coronavirus outbreaks.

In Germany, the eight outbreaks linked to the meat industry have also focused scrutiny on murky hiring practices and substandard living conditions for laborers — largely from Romania, Bulgaria and Poland — who do the grueling work of slaughtering pigs for minimum wage. Even during the peak of the epidemic on the continent, when travel between countries was banned, exceptions were made so that workers could cross borders and ensure that Western Europe could continue to eat.

Now, for many Gütersloh residents who have seen their schools, gyms, pools and bars closed once again, ire is directed both at Tönnies and government officials, who they complain have long failed to act on calls to clean up working practices.

AD

AD

“There is a lot of anger and disappointment,” said Daniela Brey, 39, who was waiting in a snaking four-hour line for a voluntary coronavirus test, with her 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter in tow.

“Tönnies is just a symptom of the problem,” she said. “The government has to do something.”

Even before the Tönnies outbreak, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government had hastily drafted new regulations to stop the use of subcontractors at Germany’s meat firms. The practice hampers the simplest question for coronavirus contact tracing: Who works there?

Legislation must still be approved by parliament, and the meat lobby is pushing back, calling the move “arbitrary discrimination” and saying it is not a means for guaranteeing worker protection.

If the legislation does come into force, it wouldn’t be until next year at the earliest — meaning that Germany will continue to face a threat of outbreaks that are difficult to trace.

AD

AD

Inge Bultschnieder, a local bakery owner, said she’d been warning about the coronavirus risk at Tönnies for months, as workers were ferried around with little regard for social distancing. “The town was worried,” she said.

Bultschnieder organized her first demonstration against Tönnies in 2013, after a hospital stay when she befriended a Bulgarian Tönnies worker in the next bed.

But in this part of Germany, meat is money. Atop the slaughterhouse, a towering Tönnies sign — featuring a smiling pig, cow and steer, tails intertwined to form a heart — is a sky-high reminder of the source of much of the wealth here.

The slaughterhouse sits on the outskirts of Rheda-Wiedenbrück, a postcard-perfect town a few miles from Gütersloh, the district’s main hub. At the site of the plant is Tönnies Arena: a 4,000-seat stadium used for local soccer matches. Clemens Tönnies, a self-made billionaire who runs the meatpacking firm, also owns Schalke, a Bundesliga soccer team.

AD

AD

His company is a giant in the European meat industry, with an annual turnover of more than 7 billion euros (about $8 billion). It slaughters more than 20.8 million pigs a year, according to industry publications.

Now, with the factory closed and more than 7,000 workers in quarantine, scores of distribution trucks sit idle, and European farmers are scrambling to find other places to slaughter their fattened livestock.

Clemens Tönnies has called it an “existential crisis” for the firm he co-founded with his brother nearly 50 years ago. Initially, the company suggested the outbreak might be attributed to cross-border travel by workers. But Clemens Tönnies apologized and said he was “fully responsible.” He has resisted calls to resign.

AD

Last year, he was forced to temporarily step down from his position as president of the Schalke soccer club after comments roundly condemned as racist. Rather than fighting climate change with tax increases, he said, governments should fund power plants in Africa. “Then the Africans would stop cutting down trees, and they would stop making babies when it gets dark,” he said.

AD

German authorities have said his company might be liable for damages related to the coronavirus outbreak.

Experts say the system of subcontracts is designed to avoid accountability, with subcompanies that continuously change their names responsible for worker safety, rather than the firms themselves.

AD

While Tönnies the company is highly visible, its workers are less so.

“They are in their own microcosm,” said Claus Freitag, 54, who runs an electronics store in ­Rheda-Wiedenbrück, not far from the town’s moated castle. “They stick together. They live in the more remote places. They jump in these minibuses in the morning.”

The Tönnies company is footing the bill for mass testing. But Clemens Tönnies cited data protection as the reason he could not share a worker list with health authorities.

Mobile coronavirus testing teams, wearing white protective overalls, have been left to largely rely on official but inaccurate city lists as they try to figure out who works at the plant and where they live.

AD

AD

“Most of the time, there’s more people or also other people than we have on the lists,” said Martin Bieker, a volunteer medic with the teams that fan out each morning.

Some of the Tönnies workers live in dilapidated low-rise apartment blocks, in cramped, unsanitary conditions that experts say probably helped the virus spread.

To enforce the quarantine, wire fences have been erected around those apartment buildings and police cars line the streets.

“If I don’t work, who will pay me if I stay two weeks at home?” said a young man at the fence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of affecting his employment.

Employers are required to continue to cover wages during quarantine, but the man said he was between jobs.

AD

Tönnies workers are paid minimum wage, about $10 an hour, but they must each pay about $350 a month for a mattress, according to activists and experts.

AD

The pay in Denmark is more than twice as high, said Karin Vladimirov, spokesperson for the meat-processing labor union representing German workers. “Nowhere is slaughtering as cheap as in Germany,” she said, adding that people often work more hours than they are paid for and lack knowledge of their rights.

So far, health officials say the outbreak in Gütersloh looks to be contained. Only 32 positive cases have been found outside the meat industry. But another outbreak has emerged at a plant in Lower Saxony. And foreign diplomats are concerned that Tönnies workers may have spread their infections farther afield, returning to their home countries in the chaotic period when a quarantine for the plant was being established.

Jakub Wawrzyniak, the Polish consul general in Cologne, spent a day out with mobile testing teams in the hopes of establishing contact with some of the Polish Tönnies workers. At some doors, neighbors said residents had “gone on holiday.”

AD

“I think that means they are at home” back in Central and Eastern Europe, he said. “If we had the data, Polish police or Bulgarian police could go and ask them to quarantine. I’m afraid it’s going to spread out.”

Meanwhile, Süzan continues to ferry workers to local firms. Each worker he brings across is charged $135 for transportation and $30 for a health certificate. The money is docked from their wages by subcontractors when they arrive, he said. He says that his workers live in good conditions and that companies responsible for the squalid conditions for workers are “black sheep.”

Even though reforms afoot in the industry could cut out subcontractors, he said he’s not worried.

“There’s always a Plan B,” he said. “As long as these companies exist, there are ways and means.”"/"['Loveday Morris', 'Berlin Bureau Chief Covering Europe', 'Luisa Beck', ""Reporter Covering Europe The Washington Post'S Berlin Bureau""]"/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/USQOPPFWKUI6VGQ52PNRZPQHZY.jpg&w=1440"

It was the first sign that they were running out of foreign currency and that the country’s economy was in deep trouble.

AD

Widespread street protests against the corruption and cronyism at the root of the country’s problems compounded the decline and paralyzed the economy for weeks. Then came the seven week-lockdown to contain the coronavirus earlier this year, which added to the pain.

AD

The reopening, now in full swing, has done little to stem what is fast turning into a major economic implosion that risks destabilizing the already volatile region. Intermittent protests against the government for failing to halt the financial free fall have served as a reminder of the potential for greater social unrest.

“The country is not doing well,” Prime Minister Hassan Diab told a meeting of Lebanon’s top politicians called by President Michel Aoun on Thursday to address the ballooning crisis. But only those who support the government showed up, leaving little hope of a consensus to address the troubles anytime soon.

Bailout talks stalled

The government is seeking a $10 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, but talks that began in February have not yet progressed beyond the preliminary stages, according to officials familiar with the proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Reforms promised by the government, ranging from its unwieldy structures and costly subsidies of essentials such as fuel and wheat, have not materialized because of the lack of political agreement.

AD

Lebanon has pegged the value of its currency to the dollar at the rate of 1,507 for the past three decades, and the government still officially maintains the level even as the pound collapses and banks halt all dollar withdrawals, except for what are called “fresh” transfers of dollars from overseas.

The banks have set other rates for certain transactions, meaning that Lebanese people now must navigate five different exchange rates, including the black market one, which is considered the most reliable indicator of the currency’s true worth.

In the absence of a clear policy path ahead, there is no bottom to the value of the Lebanese pound, said Nasser Saidi, a former Lebanese finance minister who is now a financial consultant based in Dubai.

AD

Citizens have lost trust in the banking system and the country is shifting to a cash-only economy.

AD

Some retail outlets have started accepting only dollars, which are hard to find. U.S. and European sanctions against neighboring Syria have deprived that country of dollars, too, making Lebanon the chief destination for Syrians seeking to fund imports there, increasing the demand for dollars, Saidi said.

'Going into the unknown'

Government revenue, meanwhile, has skidded to a halt because of the shutdowns and economic retraction, forcing the Central Bank to print Lebanese pounds to fund government expenditures, including salaries for the bloated civil service.

“Those go into the market and they are chasing fewer and fewer dollars,” Saidi said. “There is no longer any anchor for the value of the Lebanese pound and we are going into the unknown.”

The impact is palpable on the once-vibrant country.

AD

Businesses are closing by the day, unemployment is rising and prices are soaring. Lebanon depends on imports for more than 80 percent of its consumption, notably food, the cost of which has nearly doubled so far this year, according to government figures, raising the risk of widespread hunger.

People who once lived comfortably are struggling to get by on incomes that have lost as much as 80 percent of their real value, pushing the price of most products, and especially food, beyond their means.

“We are surviving day-to-day because we no longer have enough to cover our needs,” said Hanan Hani, 48, as she lined up earlier this week to receive food handouts from a local charity.

Serebrennikov’s suspended sentence came amid Kremlin sensitivities about an ongoing nationwide vote on constitutional changes that would allow Putin to potentially stay in power until 2036.

AD

A hefty jail term for Serebrennikov could have triggered protests, alienated young voters and distracted from the Kremlin’s efforts to ensure a high voter turnout as part of an effort to lend legitimacy to an extension to Putin’s power. Voting ends Wednesday.

AD

Serebrennikov has often voiced criticism of conservative politicians, the increasingly harsh censorship under Putin and rising authoritarianism. He spoke out for anti-government protests in 2018, has supported LGBTQ rights and criticized the rising influence of the conservative Russian Orthodox Church in political affairs.

Prosecutors at Meshchansky District Court in Moscow had demanded six years in prison for Serebrennikov, five years for producer Alexey Malobrodsky and four years for producer Yuri Itin — all convicted of embezzlement.

AD

Prosecutors also asked for a four-year sentence for art historian and former Culture Ministry employee Sofia Apfelbaum, who was convicted of negligence in handling state funds.

Serebrennikov, 50, is director of Moscow’s Gogol Center and the Seventh Studio theater. Appearing in court, he wore a black mask, dark glasses, a black cap and a gray T-shirt.

AD

He and three other defendants stood trial for the embezzlement of about 133 million rubles (more than $1.8 million) in state funds through the Platforma arts project, which he founded. The four defendants pleaded not guilty, testifying that the funds from the Culture Ministry were used only to stage theatrical productions.

AD

Judge Olesya Mendeleyeva said the Culture Ministry demanded the return of the allegedly embezzled funds.

The judge also fined Serebennikov 800,000 rubles, or about $11,5000. Malobrodsky and Itin were ordered to pay smaller fines. The three were barred from administrative positions in state cultural institutions: Serebrennikov and Itin for three years, and Malobrodsky for two.

“The court believes that the defendants can be reformed without being isolated from society,” the judge said.

AD

Serebrennikov’s lawyer, Dmitry Kharitonov, said he would appeal against the verdict.

Among those who have spoken in Serebrennikov’s defense was one of ballet’s geniuses, Mikhail Baryshnikov, who stated that the director was being persecuted for political reasons.

AD

“An artist of whom Russia should be proud is being debased and humiliated,” he said in a statement when Serebrennikov was called in for questioning in 2017. He said that because Serebrennikov “is a person who is known for his independence and love of freedom, a person who has more than once made brave political declarations, these sudden repressions look particularly foul.”

Baryshnikov defected to Canada in 1974 and holds dual U.S. and Latvian citizenship.

Many Russian actors, directors and cultural figures have spoken out for Serebrennikov since his arrest. More than 3,700 Russian cultural figures signed an open letter Monday to Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova, requesting that the ministry withdraw its charges against the defendants in what is known here as the “Seventh Studio case.”

AD

AD

Russian rapper Miron Fyodorov, who goes by Oxxxymiron, posted Thursday to his 2.1 million Instagram followers, apparently in Serebrennikov’s support, a condemnation of “custom-made lawsuits, the purpose of which is to intimidate freethinking and creative people.”

Hundreds of people gathered outside the court behind police barriers before the verdict was handed down Friday morning.

“I came here to demonstrate my support,” said a protester, Alexander Kuznetsov, 56. “Kirill is not a thief. He is a decent and very talented person. Lots of thieves are in power. Look at the Duma deputies,” he said, referring to lawmakers. “And yet they go after an innocent person.”

AD

Platforma, which staged modern theatrical, dance and musical productions, was an outlet for innovative young artists and directors and was popular among Moscow’s young crowd. It was also a platform for political satire lampooning Russian politicians. But the theater soon became a threat to authorities increasingly intolerant of dissent, activism and liberalism.

AD

“Youth always chooses freedom,” Serebrennikov told the court in his final remarks Monday. He said Platforma “gave artists and audiences a feeling that the ideals of freedom would sooner or later become the foundation of our lives in this country, too.”

Platforma accountants testified that they were ordered to embezzle the funds by the Platforma management. The prosecution said Monday the case against all defendants was proved.

AD

But one key prosecution claim — that a production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” one of the performances for which the grant money was provided, never took place — was false, the defense stated. The production won awards and toured abroad.

Human Rights Watch, PEN America’s Artists At Risk Connection and many international cultural and film organizations Thursday called on prosecutors to drop the charges and free the defendants. They argued that even if there were financial irregularities, these could have been resolved without resort to criminal charges.

AD

Serebrennikov admitted that Platforma’s accounts were sloppy but said he never involved himself in bookkeeping.

AD

“The state’s leap to criminal embezzlement charges seems to be a thinly veiled way to retaliate against Serebrennikov for his political criticism and to send a chilling message to other artists — who have no choice but to accept state funding to survive as artists — to refrain from political criticism,” the Human Rights Watch statement said. “The case is widely considered a specious attempt to punish him for his political candor and artistic nonconformism.”

Under Putin, Russian authorities have mounted increasing attacks on opposition figures, activists, journalists, bloggers and artists, arresting and jailing them, leveling fraud charges and freezing their assets and those of family members.

AD

Putin has made clear his disdain for liberal democracy, telling the Financial Times in an interview last year that liberalism was “obsolete” and was being rejected by millions of people.

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/06/24/some-zoo-animals-are-doing-fine-without-visitors-many-are-lonely-without-us/"/How zoo animals are surviving the coronavirus pandemic/"Maybe this time will be different.

The blue crowned pigeon approaches his mate and begins davening, twerking his tail toward the skylight of the Cape May County Zoo aviary as his beak dips toward earth. His intensity and focus during the mating ritual, coupled with the wild tuile topping his head, give him the look of an 18th-century composer banging away at what just might be a masterpiece. The recipient of this overture is completely still, her eyes projecting a glazed endurance.

When the dance is over — or perhaps in a move that ends the dance — the female pigeon turns and begins picking at the ground.

“We’d like them to breed, but they just can’t get it right,” sighs Janeen Moore, a zookeeper charged with caring for these birds, as well as every other winged creature at this zoo. Like the other 20 full-time keepers, she is wearing one of her many monogrammed Cape May County Zoo shirts, unisex work pants and a face mask. Moore explains that the female pigeon had been at the zoo for nearly three years before her “genetically suitable” mate arrived for this arranged marriage. Though the male has been trying to impress her since 2016, the female pigeon is simply, Moore says, “not feeling it.” The male’s efforts to woo also include repeated attempts to build a nest, but when he summons his mate to inspect his efforts, Moore says, “She comes up and goes, ‘That’s not good enough,’ and throws it all out,” knocking the insufficiently arranged sticks out of the tree and onto the ground. Every egg the dysfunctional coupling has managed to produce was either unfertilized or cracked.

After so many years, it would seem childishly optimistic to think the pigeon couple might get it right during this particular mating season. But without the peeping eyes of the usual spectators, now could be the perfect time.

Like so much of the rest of the country, the Cape May County Zoo closed in March to ensure the safety of the human public. But the closure keeps its animal inhabitants safe, too: In April, New York City’s Bronx Zoo found that eight of its big cats had contracted the coronavirus from an asymptomatic keeper, and it’s assumed primates can also be infected because of their biological similarity to humans. The sudden absence of civilians puts into focus who is really served by zoos. The institutions ostensibly exist for the preservation of animals. But if we’re honest with ourselves, conservation is often for and funded by human enjoyment of animal life; zoos, after all, are categorized by New Jersey law as “amusements.” During the pandemic, to protect animal life, zoos continue to run for the benefit of the amusers even as we forgo our own good time.

Which means no annoying people crowding around enclosures. No kids yelling or cameras flashing or cellphones accidentally dropping into their homes. There have been news stories about penguins that got to take a hike in the woods near their exhibit in Oregon and cheetahs in Providence, R.I., that were visited by a keeper in a tantalizing rabbit costume. In Hong Kong, a pair of pandas that had been haplessly failing to mate for a decade managed to consummate their union after their zoo shut to the public in January. Nature is healing, as the coronavirus-era meme says. Humans are the disease.

If that’s true, then a human-free environment is a respite for the animals of the Cape May Zoo — a blessed break from watching us watch them. Away from the strains and scrutiny of public life, without people making everything worse, maybe the blue crowned pigeons will get the chance to follow the lead of the pandas: It’s time to relax, make a baby and finally finish that home improvement project.

Peacocks and other birds are allowed to wander freely while the Cape May County Zoo is closed.

When I visited the 52-acre Cape May County Zoo in mid-May, it had been locked to the public since March 16 at the order of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. The length of this shutdown bests the previous record-holding break by several months. Since then, keepers who normally rotate between groups of the more than 600 animals there have been staying in one section to avoid cross-contamination and are working in isolation from other employees. While the zoo is a public facility that gets a budget from the county government to pay zookeeper salaries, parks director Ed Runyon says the organization runs “almost entirely” on donations from visitors, who pay no entrance fees. In spring, the zoo typically takes in about a quarter of its annual donations, which cover costs like the staggering $50,000 a month food bill. A month from now, on June 13, zoo director and head veterinarian Hubert “Doc” Paluch will enact his plan to reopen with limited visitors, one-way foot traffic and, of course, masks. If the zoo didn’t resume visitation this summer, it would lose the remaining 75 percent of its annual donations.

For now, the sudden disappearance of the humans who pay for meals is the biggest change for the animals. Which is just fine by the reptiles, says general curator and supervising animal keeper Kevin Wilson: “They certainly don’t seem to be fazed by the quiet time. I think they like it.” Wilson says during “the very bad months” of summer, “you’ve got a thousand people in this building,” gesturing around the now-quiet indoor reptile house, covered in swamp-approximating murals and lit with the sallow flicker of heat lamps. “They’re all banging on the glass, because the kids want the animals to react,” Wilson says. “And the more people bang on the glass, the more the animals just hide in the back. And some of them do stress out. They don’t eat.”

Unlike mammals, who are temporarily raised by their parents, reptiles are heuristic. “Out of the egg and on their own,” says Wilson. It’s not built into them to socialize with each other, much less people. “Alligators, crocodiles, snakes, everything like that,” Wilson lists, looking down at Ike, an eight-foot American alligator whose eyes and nostrils are the only body parts that break the meniscus of his pond. Paddling runty claws tipped with white, Cardi B-long talons, Ike silently drifts toward the voice of the man who feeds him but whom he feels nothing toward. “It’s not so much they want to be with you,” Wilson says. “You’re fulfilling a need.”

“They certainly don’t seem to be fazed by the quiet time. I think they like it,” says general curator and supervising animal keeper Kevin Wilson.

This exchange — you give me what I require to survive, I let your buddies look at me — is what I assumed to be the basis of most human-zoo animal relationships. That if animals were the aristocracy of the zoo, keepers were the staff that knew its place and the public was merely tolerated as the subjects funding the venture.

But for some animals, the attachment is more than transactional. Bird keeper Moore introduces me to Gil, a gray cockatoo who became so distressed at his newfound solitude that he began self-harming, plucking his chest feathers until he gnawed a hole in his skin that had to be covered with a vest the bird immediately ripped apart. (He was subsequently outfitted with a fetching pink polka-dot ruff that matched the peachy feathers at the back of his head.) “They love getting talked to all day,” Moore says, turning her head upside down at a blue parrot named Brat. He is used to Moore’s face, and, like everyone else, hates the masks protecting us; he repeatedly tries to remove Moore’s. “He just doesn’t think it belongs there,” she says. “You think you’re coming to the zoo to watch the animals. Well, the animals are watching you, too.” When I laugh at Moore’s words, Brat’s mate, Azur, mimics my peal back at me.

Like the parrots, the zoo’s primates socialize with humans. So do otters and camels and, unlike their reptile brethren, tortoises, which come over to keepers and excitedly play at their feet even when they know no food is forthcoming. They thrill at human contact.

Keepers are filling in the new social gap: “[The animals] look forward to their company,” says Doc. But, he tells me, “They do miss the crowds and the variety of people coming through.” Watch the news or go on Twitter or attend a peaceful protest met with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets, and you know the meme is true: Humans are almost always the disease. It feels like a miracle to find a place where our presence is a cure.

After two months of the rapture-like scene at the zoo, even animals generally apathetic to people seem to feel the loss. “I might have been a little surprised by certain species that may have missed the public more than I thought they would,” says Doc. (He clarifies that even after 31 years at the Cape May Zoo, he is not an animal psychic: “I just look at what I can observe. I certainly can’t interpret what they’re thinking.”) “I was walking by the bison,” parks director Runyon says. “Usually they don’t care about anything. But they were all coming right over and just staring at us as we were walking by.” When I cross the bridge by the massive bison enclosure, several steers, mid-spring molt, walk underneath and gaze up at me.

Later, the female half of a pair of lions comes up to the fence and pushes her haunch against the chain link for a scratch no one is allowed to give her. Based on what we saw from the cats at the Bronx Zoo, if the lioness’s keeper had the coronavirus and the lioness got near enough to her keeper to catch it, the most severe symptom she’d experience is a cough. Who is being served by these rules? “It’s the people that [the virus] is affecting,” says Doc. “It’s not affecting animals to any extent.”

Gil, a gray cockatoo, at the zoo. He became so distressed at his newfound solitude that he began self-harming.

When Michael Jackson lived at Neverland Ranch, he owned a flamboyance of Chilean flamingos. (Yes, “flamboyance” is the actual collective noun.) Though Doc insists the birds’ home at Neverland was much like the one at this zoo, they shared the property with a Ferris wheel and a full-size amusement park chair swing ride. After Jackson moved out of Neverland following his 2005 child molestation trial and acquittal, the flamingos went from being living lawn ornaments to residents of the Cape May County Zoo.

Merlin, a siamang gibbon, hangs from his enclosure.

When animals’ well-being is prioritized over their availability to be admired, an object becomes the subject; a prop transforms into the protagonist. Though this shift in values has never been starker than during this pandemic — the lives of the animals at the Cape May County Zoo are given vastly more consideration than, say, workers at a meat plant — it’s part of a broader movement in the industry. Zoos like Cape May are increasingly oriented toward welfare, which Doc says has become a “buzzword” in the past decade. Enclosures have become larger and more naturalistic, and animals have more places to secret themselves away from our gaze. They are no longer trained to perform for our enjoyment, but to sit for necessary medical treatment they used to be sedated or restrained to endure. Even if an animal is owned by Cape May County, accrediting organization the Association of Zoos & Aquariums might recommend it be sent to another facility for breeding to promote genetic diversity among an endangered species. “It’s a good thing everybody’s going more towards conservation and protect[ion], rather than showing them off,” event and program coordinator Jean Whalen says. “But it’s getting out of the entertainment business. That’s making it harder.”

A zoo’s mission is to use the human draw toward charismatic megafauna to protect those creatures. Without that trade, zoos don’t exist. Which means they have to figure out how close we can safely get, whether it’s to prevent tigers from getting the coronavirus or to allow them to live as organic and fulfilling a life as one can behind a fence. (Doc admits: “There’s nothing like seeing animals in the wild. You can see them in the zoo, which brings in the educational part of it and the conservation part of it. But just to be able to see them in the wild is extremely exciting. You know that they’re still out there.”)

“You think you’re coming to the zoo to watch the animals. Well, the animals are watching you, too,” says zookeeper Janeen Moore.

Distance protects humans, too — definitely from getting mauled, but also from the pain of attachment to what never really belonged to us. When I ask why the name of Mr. Bojangles the bobcat is not printed on the information card about his species in front of his enclosure, Whalen says, “The [keepers] don’t really like the public to know their names, because it just gets messy if something happens to that animal, and the [public] keeps expecting it to be that [same] animal. We have to explain how it went back to Kansas because it didn’t belong to us. And we had two [snow leopard] babies that passed. They were healthy, and then a parasite from being outside went to their brain. It was so sad. So it’s tricky: How much do you share with the public? Because they hurt, too.”

One of the last enclosures before the zoo’s exit is the primate habitat. A bonded pair of siamang gibbons come outside to inspect the unfamiliar person standing next to their keeper Megan Draper. It’s been a long time since they’ve seen a stranger, and the muscular duo swing across branches, patrolling their territory. After a few minutes, Merlin, the male, stills and begins the ritual he shares with his mate, Leela, every morning around 10:30. The flaccid pouch at his neck tumesces with song, sharp little honks that sound like didgeridoo notes. At first the performance is a solo. Then Leela starts to harmonize, and the second voice throbs against the first. The music is loud enough to make my chest vibrate, letting everyone in earshot know that Merlin and Leela are together and we are in their space.

The gibbons hang on the net, their bodies overlapping. Against the brightness of the sky, it’s impossible to tell where her dark body stops and his starts. They are one in silhouette, extra limbs fanning out like Shiva as they bellow their duet to their audience. And what’s the point of a song if there’s no one to hear it?

Good thing Amber Spice in Laurel has two chefs. When one of them, Saravan “Sam” Krishnan, couldn’t make it home from a trip to his native south India in March, his brother, Venkatesan, or “John,” devoted himself to the kitchen full time. It further helps that the two got their start together, as waiters at the vegetarian Udupi Palace in Takoma Park, and previously cooked side by side at the departed Curry Leaf, also in Laurel.

Their time at Udupi Palace taught them you could fill a place without the aid of meat. Much as I like the Goan shrimp curry and sizzling lamb kebabs at Amber Spice, I’m perfectly content feasting solely on vegetables.

Arranging the takeout for a group portrait on my kitchen counter not long ago, I was struck by the beauty of the spread. The forest-green spinach kofta next to the dusky gold aloo gobi alongside the shocking red paneer chili begged for a frame. Better still, the vibrant buffet delivered on the palate. Finely chopped carrots, peas, potatoes and beans lend their charms to the kofta, balls cloaked in a spinach-cream puree. Cauliflower, potatoes and onions are gently steamed so that the aloo gobi, colored with turmeric, holds its shape and texture. The cubed paneer and sauteed bell peppers, an Indo-Chinese dish, come with a one-two punch from vinegar and roasted chiles.

You may think you don’t like okra. But naysayers become converts when they taste okra as it’s coddled here: cubed, seasoned with mustard seeds, cumin seeds and half a dozen other jazz notes, and fried to a tender crunch. “Like we cook in our house,” says Venkatesan Krishnan of his light touch with oil.

Then there’s egg curry, saucy with coconut milk, tomatoes and onions and served with flaky paratha. The bread gets more delicious as it soaks up the broth, lit with ginger, chile powder and curry leaves and as close as I see myself getting to Kerala for the foreseeable future.

Krishnan says the brothers, who co-own Amber Spice with longtime friend Moses Krishnarajan, decided against naming their restaurant after a person or a village. They opted to sum up the place with a well-used ingredient. Manjal might have confused someone who wasn’t south Indian. Turmeric, its English translation, was already taken. Amber, the trio ultimately concluded, was a color diners would catch in most every bite of their radiant food.

Since the pandemic disrupted their business model, the owners at Aracosia in McLean have discovered that, much like for UPS, people love their packages. As in family dinners, a three-course menu including a bottle of wine, and vegetarian/vegan samplers. “You get to taste a bunch of things,” says Omar Masroor of the Afghan restaurant’s sampler packs. Hopefully, he says, customers “maybe come back, into the dining room” for a favorite dish.

I’m smitten with the vegetarian deal: a choice of appetizer, entree, side dish and dessert for $24 a person. While the online menu calls for a four-person minimum, that’s a request rather than a demand; without revealing my identity, I was able to order the deal for two. And had I been able to pick up the meal before 4 p.m., the cost would have been $5 less. That includes the aushak: floppy dumplings green with leeks and scallions inside and decked out with a blanket of carrots and peas, a drizzle of garlic yogurt and dustings of cayenne and dried mint. It’s my preferred starter, although the crisp turnovers with diced portobellos come close.

As for main courses, a bevy of greens — spinach, collards and kale simply seasoned with fenugreek and turmeric — go into the rib-sticking sabzi lawaan, spooned over fragrant basmati rice. And seemingly a bushel of beans — chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans — top a carton of dumplings sweetened with pumpkin. (Ask for kadu tosh peyra.) When I request a side of eggplant, the voice on the other end of the line responds with a verbal high five. My tongue has the same reaction when the vegetable, soft from roasting and set in a light tomato stew, passes my lips.

Flavor is achieved without a speck of butter. “No cream, no milk, no cheese,” either, says Masroor, whose business partner is his wife, chef Sofia. Yogurt, on the other hand, is as everywhere as athleisure. “I don’t think we can live without yogurt,” the restaurateur says of his compatriots. As in the dining room, the accompanying flatbread comes with four dips. I’m partial to the sting of vinegar and herbs in one, the cool of avocado and yogurt in another. Firni, a custard infused with cardamom and garnished with pistachios, is Afghan bliss, kissed with rose water.

News flash: The owners are conducting an experiment in Washington at their Afghan restaurant in the Palisades. They are in the process of turning their back dining room into Aracosia Market, a mini-bazaar showcasing spices, sweets, tea and more from Central Asia, North Africa, India and elsewhere. Look for the door to open in (knock on wood) September.

1381 Beverly Rd., McLean, Va. 703-269-3820. aracosiamclean.com. Open for takeout noon to 9 p.m. daily. Delivery via Door Dash, GrubHub, Seamless, Uber Eats and the restaurant (free within a three-mile radius with a minimum order of $50). A la carte entrees, $14.50 to $42.







The signature draw at Shouk may be the most labor-intensive burger in the city.

AD

“Every single ingredient is prepared separately,” says Dennis Friedman, chef and co-founder of the Middle Eastern fast-casual restaurant. No fewer than 15 vegetables and legumes — cauliflower, black beans, beets, mushrooms, etc. — go into the Shouk burger, which is held together with pureed flaxseed and slipped into tender whole-wheat pita the size of an oven mitt. Far from being a kitchen sink, the mouthful would be less without the support of each element. And the accessories are as considered as the centerpiece. Charred onions add welcome smokiness. Pickled turnips lend tang. A downy layer of peppery arugula gives the sandwich height and hue. The construction is thoughtful, beautiful and as rewarding as any of the beefy alternatives around town.

I’m not surprised when Friedman tells me the K Street original sometimes sells more than 200 Shouk burgers a day. Or that the vast majority of the eatery’s customers aren’t vegetarian. Good taste is the driving force behind the plant-based menu. The kitchen also makes an eggplant burger, based on the Israeli dish sabich, and I like it almost as much as the bestseller. Like the Shouk burger, the sliced eggplant is soft in parts, crusty in others. Unlike the burger, the fried eggplant comes with bun mates of magenta cabbage and sheer potato slices.

As detailed as the Shouk burger sounds, Friedman says he put more time into his chickpea fritters. “Everybody knows falafel,” says the chef, who launched the kosher business four years ago with Ran Nussbacher, a native of Israel with a background in technology. The brown spheres are green with parsley and cilantro in their centers, fluffy thanks to sparkling water in the mix. My preferred way to enjoy the wonderful falafel is atop a bowl of hummus, whipped up fresh daily with chickpeas imported from the Middle East.

Shouk is Hebrew for “market,” an image the owners hoped to capture in their restaurant, designed with a walk-in cooler that gets replenished every two days and an open kitchen for transparency. Before the pandemic, orders were called out, to create a little buzz in the place. A larger sibling is located at 395 Morse St. NE, near Union Market.

You don’t have to live close to either branch to enjoy Shouk, which rolled out its own delivery service, Hood Drop, to neighborhoods across the region in mid-March, partly to feed fans whose jobs used to put them downtown. More vegetables for everyone!

655 K St. NW. 202-945-4747. shouk.com. Open for takeout 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. Delivery via Caviar, DoorDash, Postmates, Uber Eats and the restaurant’s Hood Drop (weekly schedule published online). Salads and sandwiches, $10 to $13.

Their actions say they do have racial preferences./"Like so many prior actions that Americans are now reevaluating about race, dating preference has to be put under the microscope. Racial bias is insidious, only surfacing when someone challenges a societal norm or a personal choice. My industry has allowed daters who claim to be friendly advocates of black people to hide racial bias under the guise of dating preferences for far too long.

In my very first session with clients, as they begin the process of identifying their ideal mate, we always discuss racial preferences. It’s usually easy to convince them that inner qualities matter more for long-term compatibility than physical attributes such as height and weight, yet if a racial preference comes up, we have to dig in deeper.

AD

AD

That’s when I bring out the Five Whys, a business technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. I begin with a question like “Why didn’t you check the box for black in your dating preferences?” The initial response is usually a surface-level reaction like, “I’ve just never dated anyone black before,” to which I reply, “Why?” Each answer leads to a deeper question that drives my clients into a challenging self-reflection. As we peel back the layers of the onion, we often find unconscious bias at the core, which has been shaped over time by family, media imagery and personal experiences.

In his 2014 book “Dataclysm,” Christian Rudder, co-founder of the OkCupid dating app, published data about its users’ hypocritical statements about racial bias. OkCupid bases users’ compatibility on their answers to wide-ranging questions on subjects such as lifestyle and current events. In the book Rudder says 84 percent of OkCupid users responded that they would not date someone who exhibited a strong racial bias, yet based on OkCupid’s user data, most of the people at the time were not responding to messages from users of a different race.

As a writer for Date Lab, I’ve seen instances of coded racial bias. The application does not ask for racial preferences, but daters might say they have a thing for blondes or list celebrity crushes of only one race. The subtext is crystal clear.

Francesca Hogi, love coach and host of the “Dear Franny” podcast, interprets code words like “all-American” to mean white and “exotic” to mean a person of color to Caucasian daters.

Francesca, who is black but coaches daters of all races, has found that about 10 percent of her white clients state a racial preference, compared with about 50 percent of her black clients. She told me: “For my black clients, usually their preference is based on who they think will like them. They often don’t have the experience of being asked out by white men, so they assume these men aren’t interested.”

AD

Black women aren’t wrong about this perceived rejection. “Dataclysm” also revealed that black women received the fewest responses of any racial group.

AD

Francesca continued: “Some worry they’ll be fetishized by any nonblack men who are interested in them. Other times they feel strongly that it’s important to have a partner who knows what it’s like to be black, and they don’t want to educate anyone about their experiences.”

While I can understand the feeling of being burdened by having to explain our culture to a partner, I believe learning from someone you love is the fastest way to bridge the divide between us.

But what if you’re just not attracted to someone outside of your race? That’s hard to defend when you understand why we have attraction to certain races and aversion to others. Did you only have a model of a successful white couple in your household? Have you, like most of us, been limited to European standards of beauty in media and advertising? Are you simply terrified of saying the wrong thing at Thanksgiving dinner?

Carmelia speaks for many love professionals like Francesca and me when she says, “Eliminating an entire race of people truly limits one’s potential to date and find a life partner.” Furthermore, I tell my clients that no choice in life is more important than who you choose to spend it with, so if you really believe that black lives matter, it’s time to put your dating choices in alignment with your values."/['Damona Hoffman']/2020-06-18 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GE76KUVRPUI6VBLNKBKCSZZV4U.jpg&w=1440"

Trump plan for a coronavirus vaccine is, well, warped./"Because I am sensitive to charges that the media nitpicks every utterance from this particular president — looking for “gotcha” mistakes — I decided to do precisely the opposite by lining up scientific support for his plan, starting with its very name. So I got on the phone with Sean Carroll, a renowned theoretical physicist at Cal Tech. Sean specializes in quantum mechanics, gravity and cosmology. He is an internationally recognized expert on the Higgs boson, an extremely important tiny thing that apparently only he understands. I don’t want to overstate Sean’s credentials for the purpose of inflating the gravitas of this column, but he is basically Isaac Newton, with less foofy hair.

Me: So, this warp speed thing! Going at warp speed — literally at, or faster than, the speed of light — how fast can the president bring this project in? Might it be done already?

AD

AD

Sean: Warp speed is physically impossible. It is unfeasible based on absolutely everything we know about the laws of physics. I am 99.99 percent confident of that.

Me: Surely, that can’t be true! The president said it! Also it was on “Star Trek”!

Sean: As you accelerate incrementally to speeds closer to the speed of light, it takes more and more energy until you would have to expend more than an infinite amount of energy. So.

Me: So ...

Sean: That was just a rephrasing of the fact that you literally can’t do it.

To understand warp speed, it’s helpful to understand the famed Karate Neck Chop, a device used in early “Mission: Impossible” episodes and other low-budget 1960s-era TV shows. It is employed when the hero is being held at gunpoint by the bad guy. This is resolved when the hero delivers a karate chop to the back of the bad guy’s neck, briefly knocking him out and thus facilitating an escape, thereby resolving a plot problem without turning the hero into a murderer. For a book, I once consulted a neurologist who assured me that this maneuver is impossible, but if it were possible, it would also cause death.

AD

AD

Same background to warp speed. Though it has been twisted over the years to refer to the fastest possible speed, the only valid way to define it is by its original meaning. It was a baseless theoretical contrivance used to solve plot problems in science fiction, because if you couldn’t fly faster than the speed of light, you could never get to another star system — the distances are too great, meaning there would be no strange new worlds to visit, aliens to see, etc. “To boldly go where no man has gone before” is a better tag line than “You can’t get there from here.”

Actually, Sean told me there is one possibility for interplanetary travel by humans, but he warned me it would sound far-fetched: “However,” he said, “it is easier to imagine extending the human life span to thousands of years, than that we might travel at the speed of light.”

I had one last idea to save the president’s terminology, and broached it: Wormholes!

AD

AD

Sean: Ah, wormholes. Well, here’s the thing. As my colleague Kip Thorne once said, if there were such a shortcut through space and time, you’d be able to go back in time and kill your grandparents.

Me: So?

Sean: So, no.

Ninety-nine years ago in Tulsa, white mobs torched the black side of town and killed as many as 300 residents, with the tacit support of some in law enforcement, in one of the worst spasms of racial violence in American history. Last month in Minneapolis, George Floyd died with a white police officer’s knee pressed to his neck, just days ahead of the May 31-June 1 anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre. Those two episodes bookend nearly a century in which civil rights progress has been fitful, hard-fought and unfinished. Across 10 decades, from Tulsa to today — against a backdrop of lynching and cross burning, more recently replaced by police chokeholds and vigilante gunshots, amid the subtler violence of systemic racism — voices have been raised in protest and defiance.

Words spoken in times of uplift or assault, hope or despair, can crystallize a moment or a movement: I have a dream. ... Black Power. ... I can’t breathe. ... Black Lives Matter. The voices collected here elaborate and extend the mantras, such as Langston Hughes versifying his insistence that America live up to its myth, and James Baldwin defining protest as a duty.

But how many other voices have been lost? For a long time the Tulsa massacre was barely mentioned in history books. The account of eyewitness B.C. Franklin quoted here surfaced only in 2015. Today it’s harder for people and events to be ignored because another phrase from protests past — The whole world is watching — has literally come true, thanks to the cameras in every potential witness’s pocket. The recent demonstrations were sparked by a bystander’s video of George Floyd’s death — and they have ended up generating more evidence of excessive force used by police against demonstrators in Washington, Buffalo, Philadelphia, New York and Atlanta.

The images presented here, photographed in late May and early June, capture the passion, anger and hope of new voices demanding to be heard. The raised fists communicate as directly as the cardboard signs — hand-lettered with yet more indelible words — while the fleeting tears of a young demonstrator and the warm embrace of comrade marchers speak of the vulnerability and pain at the root of any protest.

The juxtaposition of the historic voices and contemporary images underscores how much work is left to be done. Read in the context of today’s clamors for justice, the decades-old diagnoses and laments sound remarkably — and wrenchingly — fresh and relevant. That those dreams remain unfulfilled speaks to an American futility and systemic failure. Seen in that light, the images of today become part of the canon of timeless illustrations documenting the unfinished struggle.

The killing of George Floyd offers yet another tragic opportunity to continue an erratic process of change begun long ago. No one can say if this time will be different. All we can know is that these voices echoing from the past put their faith in the future — and that these demonstrators insist that the future is now.

For fully forty eight hours, the fires raged and burned everything in its path and it left nothing but ashes and burned safes and trunks and the like where once stood beautiful homes and business houses. And so proud, rich, black Tulsa was destroyed by fire — that is its buildings and property; but its spirit was neither killed nor daunted.

Though I have found no Negroes who want to see the United Nations lose this war, I have found many who, before the war ends, want to see the stuffing knocked out of white supremacy and of empire over subject peoples. American Negroes, involved as we are in the general issues of the conflict, are confronted not with a choice but with the challenge both to win democracy for ourselves at home and to help win the war for democracy the world over.

No, I’m not an American. I’m one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy. So, I’m not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag saluter, or a flag waver — no, not I. I’m speaking as a victim of this American system. And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don’t see any American Dream; I see an American nightmare.

See, it’s time for America to wake up and know that we’re not going to tolerate — we’re not begging anymore. And I’m not going to say it’s not any more of us going to die, because I’m never sure when I leave home whether I’ll get back home or not. But if I fall while I’m in Kentucky, I’ll fall five feet and four inches forward for freedom, and I’m not backing off it. And nobody will have to cover the ground that I walk on as far as freedom is concerned because I know as well as you should know that no man is an island to himself, and until I’m free in Mississippi, you’re not free in no other place.

Then he came. She just didn’t move. We didn’t used to have to wait for the word. And the history of black people in this country is those people who got up and moved, all over this country.

We imagined a more humane future, but we also risked our very lives to defeat racism and U.S. military aggression against Southeast Asia. Now, it is your turn to imagine a more humane future — a future of justice, equality and peace. And if you wish to fulfill your dreams, which remain the dreams of my generation as well, you must also stand up and speak out against war, against joblessness and against racism.

What happened in Los Angeles in April of 1992 was neither a race riot nor a class rebellion. Rather, this monumental upheaval was a multiracial, trans-class, and largely male display of justified social rage. For all its ugly, xenophobic resentment, its air of adolescent carnival, and its downright barbaric behavior, it signified the sense of powerlessness in American society.

This is where we are right now. It’s a racial stalemate we’ve been stuck in for years. ... But I have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people, that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that, in fact, we have no choice — we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.

We know how to be racist. We know how to pretend to be not racist. Now let’s know how to be antiracist.

I came to this city in 1955, which was the year that the body of Emmett Till was found in a body of water in Mississippi, same year that Rosa Parks refused to give up the back seat on the bus. ... Since that time, I have seen any number of struggles against racism, and they have all ended up with relatively little outcome. So the question is valid, it’s a reasonable question: Is this going to be just like so many other movements, a moment of anger and rage and then back to business as usual? ... [But] his death did not simply start a bunch of good speeches, a bunch of tributes. Out of his death has come a movement, a worldwide movement. And that movement is not going to stop after two weeks, three weeks, a month. That movement is going to change the world.

Now it needs Congress’s support./"Stars and Stripes has been chronicling the military angle of the covid-19 crisis for months now: sailors infected on Navy ships, face masks purchased for the Department of Defense workforce, stimulus checks cut for veterans. But in the midst of the pandemic, the newspaper faces an unprecedented threat all its own: In February, the Trump administration proposed eliminating all of the publication’s federal support in 2021. That’s more than $15 million a year, about half its budget. “I can’t think of a graver threat to its independence,” the paper’s ombudsman, Ernie Gates, told me recently. “That’s a fatal cut.”

AD

Defense Secretary Mark Esper justifies the cut by saying the publication’s money should be spent on “higher-priority issues,” including space and nuclear programs. But considering that Stars and Stripes represents a minuscule fraction of the department’s $705 billion budget — “decimal dust,” as editorial director Terry Leonard puts it — critics see the proposal as consistent with the president’s broader war on journalism. “It’s another obnoxious assault by the Trump administration on freedom of the press,” says Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a Marine veteran and member of the House Armed Services Committee, who blasts the defunding plan as “un-American.”

Now Moulton’s committee — and ultimately the rest of Congress — must decide whether to support the appropriation by the fall, preserving a news organization with a unique civic role. This deliberation comes as the coronavirus economic crisis exacerbates the news industry’s financial woes, adding to what The Washington Post recently described as a “tsunami of layoffs, cutbacks, furloughs and closures” washing over American newsrooms.

Stars and Stripes, which dates back to the Civil War, has published continuously since World War II. In 2010, the paper won a prestigious George Polk Award for revealing the Defense Department’s use of a public relations firm that profiled reporters and steered them toward favorable coverage of the war in Afghanistan. In 2015, the publication broke the news that NBC anchor Brian Williams had exaggerated a story about his reporting in Iraq. Much of the day-to-day coverage is news of direct concern to service members and their families: pay and benefits, life on base and in the field, the real people behind the global geopolitics.

AD

The paper is a modern multimedia operation with a website, a social media presence and a couple of podcasts, and the print edition reaches troops in parts of the world where Internet access is absent. “I remember being in al-Anbar and Haditha and picking up Stars and Stripes in the middle of a war zone,” says Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), one of Moulton’s committee colleagues and a fellow Marine veteran. “I didn’t have a cellphone. Access to the Internet was very limited. But with every mail delivery there came a Stars and Stripes, and I was able to keep connected to the world.”

“Stars and Stripes kept our spirits up and kept us informed at some of the most difficult times,” says Moulton, who served four tours of duty in Iraq. “Just knowing they were out there doing their job — looking out for us by doggedly pursuing the truth — gave us more faith in our work and reinforced the values we were literally putting our lives on the line for.” The paper’s publisher, Max Lederer, told me, “You can give a service member the best gun in the world, but if his mind is elsewhere — if he’s worried about things at home — then he’s not going to be as good a soldier, and part of our role is to provide that information to give him a sense of comfort.”

Though the Trump administration is the first to propose defunding the paper, there has always been a natural tension between Stars and Stripes and the Pentagon. The paper’s editorial staffers are Department of Defense employees, but their charge is different from — and sometimes at odds with — that of the military’s public affairs team. Elaine McCusker, the Pentagon’s acting comptroller, told reporters in February, “that newspaper is probably not the best way that we communicate any longer.” But that misrepresents what the paper is meant to communicate. “We’re not there to provide the command message,” Lederer told me. “We’re there to analyze the command message and to provide information necessary for the military community.”

AD

AD

Another impediment to providing that information, Lederer said, is a Pentagon that restricts journalistic access more than under previous administrations. Fewer reporters are allowed to travel with military officials. Asking questions in informal “gaggles” is no longer routine, and formal briefings were discontinued until Esper revived them. In general, information is harder to come by, inhibiting reporters from playing their watchdog role.

But Stars and Stripes has always garnered strong bipartisan support from another Pentagon watchdog: Congress. And that looks likely to continue this year. “We have the numbers,” Gallego told me. “I think we have the votes.” Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, likewise opposes cutting the funding, despite asserting that “Secretary Esper is right to look for efficiencies.”

“This service cannot be duplicated in the private sector and should be maintained,” Thornberry said in a statement to The Post. “Ultimately, ‘Stripes’ should be preserved, but the business model will have to change so that the program can be maintained without taxing DOD resources.” But Thornberry concedes the fundamental point: “Stars and Stripes performs a useful function for men and women in uniform, particularly those who are forward deployed with limited access to news.” As Gates puts it, “Nobody else covers the Defense Department schools in Japan.”

But you can’t be a historian of black America without being hopeful. Because this is a group of people who, in many ways, believed in a country that didn’t believe in them. So for me, there is always hope. There is always resilience. That also is what inspires me to always tell the unvarnished truth. And I would argue that in a partisan time what you need more than anything else is clarity based on scholarship, understanding and trying to find reconciliation and truth.

AD

AD

How are you thinking about ways the Smithsonian can be that glue in this time of isolation?

What I’ve realized is that the wonders of the Smithsonian need to get outside of the Smithsonian, so sort of really taking advantage of our digital commitment. We’ve always had a digital commitment, but it was always sort of secondary. So now everything is digital.

The second piece that’s really crucial for us to recognize is that life will never return to exactly the way it once was. So we begin to think: What’s the new normal? What does it mean for cultural institutions if people aren’t going to come back in the same numbers? What does it mean if people are now more comfortable with the digital world? What does it mean for staff who are now more comfortable teleworking? There are fundamental issues about what the new normal means. And I think you don’t try to re-create the museum digitally. It’s a very different experience. I love the social interaction that people have when they stand in front of Harriet Tubman’s hymnal or when they’re standing in front of a dinosaur trying to explain that to a 10-year-old; I want to always make sure that’s there. But we have to now think about: Okay, how do you create a different kind of interaction digitally?

AD

AD

Do you think museums ever will cease to be physical entities?

No. It’s interesting, when we started building the African American Museum, that was a conversation we had, right? Should this be all virtual? And we felt that at the Smithsonian, most people come for the authentic. They want to see the ruby slippers or the Hope Diamond or the Greensboro lunch counter. So we felt that our job was to find the tension between technology and traditional. We want to find the balance between releasing things and saying, Go at it, versus giving people more guidance: Here’s how to look at this; here’s how to think about that. I think this is a horrible time. But it’s also a time that encourages us to think about things differently because the country will never be exactly the same.

When you left the Chicago Historical Society to create the African American Museum, you said you thought of it as a move from doing something for yourself versus for your ancestors. How then did you think about your move to head the Smithsonian system?

AD

AD

Good question. [Laughs.] Building the African American Museum was something I did for my ancestors, for my dad, for my mother, even for myself. But being able to help the whole Smithsonian was really my way to give back to the place I love the most. To the place that has shaped my career. It's where I met my wife. So it was more about: How can I give back to the place that transformed my life and gave me not just a career, but a calling?

Can you talk about a moment in your career when it felt like it was all coming together: You’re in the place you’re meant to be, doing the work you’re meant to do?

Well, sure. There was a point when we were building the African American Museum, still conceptualizing, when I was able to hire other curators. And suddenly it was no longer just my idea. I remember being in a meeting where we were talking about what this museum could be, what some of the stories were. There were scholars from around the country, there were staff there. And suddenly I realized that this is going to work. It was going to work because all these people bought in and were now taking this hope of mine and making it real in ways I could never have imagined. I’ve never forgotten that moment of feeling that we could pull this off. The other one is when I was part of a small group that opened the California African American Museum in Los Angeles in time for the Olympic Games. I was doing the big exhibit on the history of blacks in the Olympics. I didn’t know a lot of what I was doing; I was making it up as I went along. And I was in a meeting where I called together Olympic athletes who participated from the ’60s into the ’80s. So there I am, in front of all these amazing athletes — you know, John Carlos, Tommie Smith, all these people — and I’m trying to convince them to support this idea and that it was going to be great. They were kind of, like, “I don’t know. We’ve heard this before. Are we going to get paid for this?” And I was getting frustrated. And as I was getting frustrated, apparently my New Jersey accent kept coming out. So John Carlos, you know, of the Black Power salute, said to me, “Wait a minute. You sound like you’re from Jersey. Are you from Jersey?”

AD

AD

Because he’s from Harlem, right?

That’s right. And he stood up, and he said, “This guy is from Jersey. You can trust him.” And they all came around after that. And so, for me, it was one of those moments of serendipity and luck. What if I hadn’t gotten tired? What if I didn’t have a Jersey accent? Those moments where things came together beyond my wildest dreams.

What’s the most important advice you’ve gotten?

That the work you do shouldn't be about you. It should be about the greater good. It should help people understand themselves better. Also, I'll never forget, I was working on an exhibition and really wanted to understand slavery through the lens of a plantation. So I was in Georgetown, South Carolina, and [met] Princy Jenkins, this quiet man in his 90s who had been the caretaker for a long time. He began to tell me what it was like for his ancestors. He gave me advice that was so important. He said, ""If you're a historian, your job is to help people understand not just what they want to remember, but what they need to remember.""

There is something deeply reassuring that when many people are moved or scared or grieving, their intuitive impulse is not to shout or rant, but to harness their feelings of compassion and hope in a form of expression older than Homer, a form originally designed for timelessness, to last through generations, even among the illiterate. Poetry — which prompts you with rhymes — is far easier to memorize than prose, so even illiterates could hear it and pass it along.

I dipped into the Post mail again earlier this month.

Those readers who attempted rhyme were stymied by their own tin ears (no, “coughing” does not rhyme with “sobbing”) as well as the peculiar rhyme-defying lexicon of the day: pandemic, hydroxychloroquine, misery, dictator, social distancing, etc. Those who went for blank verse seemed to think that anything, however banal,

is automatically

a poem if it’s in lowercase and

the lines

have random

spacing and raggedy

ends.

And again, every single one of these poems moved me. All were rejected, but you can have this instead.

We’re all wearing masks, again and again

We look just like a nation of holdup men.

The White House harbors a would-be dictator

He’s half ignoramus (the other half hater).

AD

Too many people have died or are dying

Words from our leader are bloated and lying.

Not even a president (nor a king nor a queen)

AD

Should ever be pimping hydroxychloroquine.

Where compassion is called for, cruelties rule.

We’re out of work, our kids out of school.

And then, in the thrall of a heartless pandemic?

More confirmation of a breakdown systemic.

Black people perishing — killed by police

Under the guise of protecting the peace.

One victim dies while taking a knee

An irony lost on no one but he

Who has found it convenient to further divide us

To rant and to sputter and not stand beside us.

And so in the midst of this countrywide misery

He just fans the flame on the Devil’s rotisserie.

AD

Which leads to mass rallies to show our disgust

Ignoring our safety, to protest the unjust —

We know in our hearts that the plague is still there.

And we say with our presence we no longer care.

We’re out in the thousands, defying the brass.

Defying the truncheons, the bullets, the gas.

AD

Masks have come off, and in our resistance-ing

We shout in close quarters, ignore social distancing.

It’s reckless, incautious, unwise and un-smart

And wonderful, bracing and noble of heart.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s at the core of this.

Telling the bastards we won’t take any more of this.

Of the nearly 20,000 complaints filed in April, nearly 90 percent concerned refunds. By comparison, consumers filed just over 1,200 complaints in April of last year. The vast majority of those were about flight problems, including cancellations and delays. Only 98 concerned refunds.

AD

AD

United recorded the highest number of complaints. American Airlines ranked second.

Airlines for America, the airline trade group, said: “U.S. airlines comply with all federal laws and regulations. Accordingly, refunds are issued to passengers when flights are canceled by the airline. Throughout the pandemic, U.S. airlines have updated travel policies to offer increased flexibility for customers, and the Department of Transportation’s website offers clarity for consumers with questions.”

The carriers’ reluctance to provide refunds has drawn particular outrage because airlines received more than $50 billion in bailout funds as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package known as the Cares Act.

AD

Southwest, United and Spirit airlines have all been sued by consumers outraged that carriers offered them vouchers or credits for future trips rather than cash.

AD

The dramatic increase in complaints has also prompted warnings from the Transportation Department. In May, the department issued a second enforcement notice reminding carriers of their obligations under consumer protection laws. Although the notice does not guarantee that travelers will receive refunds, it offers them additional information about their rights — and reminds airlines that they could face consequences if they refuse to comply.

In a statement that accompanied the notice, officials said the department will be monitoring airlines’ refund practices and would issue letters or fines “as necessary.” Until then, it would give airlines “an opportunity to come into compliance.”

AD

In March, as the issue was heating up, a group of nine senators, including Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), wrote to airlines saying that the pandemic was putting an “enormous financial strain on millions of Americans,” and that carriers had “a moral responsibility to provide real refunds, not travel vouchers” to consumers.

AD

Based on information received from airlines, the lawmakers estimated that carriers were potentially holding on to as much as $10 billion in consumer cash.

Airlines have shifted some policies in response to consumer complaints, but some travelers still report running into problems when they have asked for their money back. Airline executives said they are trying to accommodate consumers, but are struggling to stay afloat in the midst of the worst downturn in industry history.

AD

Friday’s report also showed how dramatically airlines have cut their operations. Airlines scheduled fewer than half the number of flights they did in March and ultimately ended up canceling 41 percent of the ones that were scheduled within a week of their scheduled departure. It was the highest number of cancellations on record, exceeding the number canceled in September 2001, the month of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

With editor Clay Felker, he co-founded New York magazine in 1968 and went on to design hundreds of issues that “established the format for the now-ubiquitous city magazine,” said Michael Bierut, a prominent New York graphic designer.

AD

However, Mr. Glaser’s renown rested foremost on the I ❤ NY motif, which was adapted, with slight modifications, around the world. “People everywhere were anxious to say, ‘I love something, ” Mr. Glaser said in a 2019 interview for this obituary.

AD

So popular was the formulation that it became a kind of logo for the Bronx-born Mr. Glaser himself. With a deep voice, precise elocution and extraordinary powers of description, he served as a de facto spokesman for his profession. He was the only graphic designer ever to receive the National Medal of Arts, bestowed on him by President Barack Obama in 2010.

“At a time when European designers, especially in Switzerland, were defining the terms of vanguard design, Milton Glaser helped launch an alternative ethos rooted in American pop culture and counterculture,” said Ellen Lupton, senior curator of contemporary design at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. “His more personal, narrative and permissive design philosophy itself became a worldwide phenomenon.”

AD

One of Mr. Glaser’s most important early commissions came in 1966, when Columbia Records hired him to design a poster to be packaged with the “Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits” LP. He created a silhouette of Dylan with a mane of twisted, brightly colored locks. More than 6 million copies were printed, making the poster a signature artifact of the “psychedelic era.” (Mr. Glaser later designed posters for such entertainers as Mick Jagger, Aretha Franklin and Jerry Garcia.)

AD

Mr. Glaser traced the origins of the Dylan design to a Marcel Duchamp self-portrait from the 1950s and the jewel-like colors of Islamic art.

He often drew on the past to create images that seemed to capture the present. For the 1993 Broadway run of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer- and Tony-winning drama “Angels in America,” Mr. Glaser designed a poster inspired by Albrecht Dürer’s 16th-century watercolor “Wing of a European Roller.”

AD

In 1977, the New York State Department of Commerce launched an ad campaign to attract tourists and, not incidentally, improve the morale of New Yorkers amid a crime wave and financial crisis that had New York City teetering on bankruptcy. Mr. Glaser was tasked with creating a logo to accompany the state’s new slogan: “I love New York.”

He drew the original logo, with a heart in place of the word “love,” in the back of a taxi. That drawing, in red crayon on a scrap of paper, is now housed in the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Glaser received a nominal fee, which he accepted because he expected the campaign to last, at most, a few months.

AD

“There was a sense of desperation, despair, and also impotence that follows these kinds of conditions,’’ Mr. Glaser told the New York Times in 2008.

AD

“It is one of those peculiarities of your own life where you don’t know the consequences of your own actions. Who in the world would have thought that this silly little bit of ephemera would become one of the most pervasive images of the 20th century?”

Mr. Glaser’s other seminal contribution to New York iconography was the magazine he founded with Felker, who once called Mr. Glaser “a gigantic creative force.”

His “densely packed layouts and illustrated ‘best-of’ listicles,’ ” Bierut noted, “became the visual corollary to the brand of urban service journalism that Felker pioneered.”

Among his other contributions to the magazine, Mr. Glaser co-wrote (with Jerome Snyder) “The Underground Gourmet,” a column about affordable restaurants. The column and guidebook by the same name helped shift attention from haute cuisine to varied ethnic fare.

AD

AD

Mr. Glaser designed restaurant logos and menus and even interiors, including that of the Windows on the World restaurant atop the World Trade Center. He also reimagined the struggling Grand Union supermarket chain at the behest of its owner, tycoon James Goldsmith. Mr. Glaser began by giving the chain a new logo: a bright red circle nestled in the letter A. He then tackled labels, signs and the designs of the stores themselves, placing giant pears in front of some. Mr. Glaser said the grocery-store makeover appealed to him because it was anti-elitist.

The son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary who ran a dry cleaning business, Milton Glaser was born June 26, 1929, and was raised in a Bronx housing complex dubbed Little Moscow for its population of leftists. Some residents were labor and civil rights activists who championed racially integrated housing.

He later told the Times that growing up amid that ferment was “like heaven” during the Great Depression. “You had this enormous commitment to the idea of human possibility, that you didn’t have to just accept existing conditions, you could change yourself and change society.”

AD

AD

At 8, he developed rheumatic fever and spent a year-long convalescence in bed. He passed the time creating an entire city of figurines from the pounds of clay his mother brought him. “Art had redeemed my life,” he told Believer magazine, “because I was never bored for a minute that whole year.”

As the years passed, young Milton became known for his ability to draw almost anything, as well as for his entrepreneurial instincts; he sketched naked women for older boys for a nickel apiece.

He studied at the High School of Music & Art in Manhattan, for which he later designed a logo, pro bono. With letters arranged on a musical staff, it was, he said, the only logo in the world that could be sung. After graduating in 1947, he enrolled at Manhattan’s Cooper Union.

AD

At the time, graphic designers learned a modernist style that eschewed colorful flourishes. But a Fulbright scholarship, after Mr. Glaser graduated in 1951, took him to Italy, where he absorbed centuries of art history and studied with Giorgio Morandi, a painter of still-lifes so pared down they were considered revolutionary.

AD

“It shifted me from modernism as the only resource to draw on,” he said. “History was not the enemy. You could use anything as raw material to make something.”

Returning to New York, Mr. Glaser had to decide whether to pursue fine art or commercial art — a distinction he eventually helped erode. He settled on commercial art because, he said, “I wanted to do work that was public. I wanted to do work that was on the street. I wanted to do work that people saw.”

AD

From 1954 to 1974, Mr. Glaser ran Push Pin Studios, which, he said, “celebrated all the things that the modernists taught us to hate.” Among those was surrealism. In many of his illustrations, Mr. Glaser juxtaposed items of vastly different scales, creating a slightly fantastical effect reminiscent of the work of René Magritte.

When he felt that his output had become repetitive, Mr. Glaser disbanded the studio. “Push Pin had become a style,” he said, “and I don’t trust style.” He continued to work — under the aegis of Milton Glaser Inc. — in a red brick building on East 32nd Street that he bought in 1965. (He sold the building in 2019.)

AD

Mr. Glaser cultivated an informal office environment that rewarded constant interaction, even interruption. He never had to write a memo, he once said, because everybody who worked for him heard everything that happened in the office.

From 1968 to 1977, he devoted much of his time to New York magazine. In 1983, he and Walter Bernard, another prominent designer, opened a publication design firm called WBMG. They designed or redesigned scores of publications, including The Washington Post, the Village Voice, Esquire, Paris Match and the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, efforts chronicled in a 2019 book, by Glaser and Bernard, called “Mag Men.”

Mr. Glaser’s other publications included the book “The Design of Dissent,” a volume published in 2005 with his frequent collaborator Mirko Ilić, documenting protest posters, buttons and the like, a few of them by Mr. Glaser. He was the subject of a 2008 documentary, “Milton Glaser: To Inform and Delight.”

AD

In 1957, he married Shirley Girton, a Cooper Union graduate who became an artist, author and gallery director. The couple collaborated on several illustrated books, ostensibly for children. She is his only immediate survivor.

Mr. Glaser mentored several generations of students, first at Cooper Union and then at the School of Visual Arts, an art and design college in Manhattan where he eventually served as acting board chair and to which he donated his archives.

In his later years, Mr. Glaser took on such clients as the Brooklyn Brewery and the Theatre for a New Audience and devoted more time to his first love: drawing. “Making art, he said, “is an expression of a very fundamental instinct of the species.”

He was so closely associated with the “psychedelic era” that in 2014, the producers of “Mad Men,” the AMC drama set in the advertising world, asked him to design a poster for the series’s final season, set in 1969 and 1970.

“I got a little scared,” Mallazzo said. “I’ve seen bagpipes mean bad things.”

Henderson, 56, did not intend to haunt. On Fridays amid the pandemic, the Iowa native walks six doors down from his house here in Brooklyn, stands alone on the corner and plays to honor the dead — 22,000 and counting, according to city data — in his adopted city.

AD

Neighbors lean out windows; others watch from rooftops. Drivers honk car horns; policemen flash lights. Requests come; applause follows.

AD

“Play ‘Scotland the Brave!’” shouted one dog walker.

Proper gigs are rare these days. In March, the busiest month on the bagpiper’s calendar, Henderson’s competitive band, Saffron United, stepped off at only one St. Patrick’s Day parade. Then, “the unthinkable” happened, he recalled. The city canceled its legendary celebration for the first time in more than 250 years.

The world championships in Glasgow, Scotland, where he planned to compete in August, were called off, too. And then the funerals. Because of New York’s social-distancing restrictions, cemetery directors limited burials to 10 mourners.

AD

Henderson, who has played everywhere from Radio City Music Hall to Woodlawn Cemetery, was left to idle, tuning his pipes and timing his steps.

“I thought I had a line on a gig to stand across the street from someone’s house,” he said, “but nothing came of it.”

Henderson first heard a call for bagpipers almost 20 years ago. In October 2001, he listened to a radio newscaster assert there weren’t enough pipers in the city to play all of the police officer and firefighter funerals following the 9/11 attacks. Later that week, while in his NYU office not far from Ground Zero where he worked in information systems, a pipe band marched by in a Halloween parade.

“I heard children laughing rather than people weeping,” he said. “I could still hear them as I looked up the number to call to take lessons.”

Henderson knew a few notes. His mother, Dorothy, a schoolteacher, insisted he learn the piano as a boy in Iowa City. He read music on a white upright piano in their house and picked up the baritone horn in fifth grade.

He played football as a high school freshman before transitioning to the marching band. While a student at the University of Illinois he played the baritone horn in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, Calif., when the Illini reached the Rose Bowl. He earned two engineering degrees but put down the horn upon graduating.

“There aren’t a whole lot of marching band opportunities available outside of college,” he says. “It’s just a muscle that atrophies, but it doesn’t go away.”

The pipes were his first musical endeavor since college. Practicing proved therapeutic as the city started its recovery.

AD

At the end of each workday, he closed his office door and fiddled with his practice chanter. In search of a venue where he would not be interrupted, he ventured into Prospect Park after nightfall, where he practiced in Friends Cemetery, a Quaker burial ground where teenagers often smoke marijuana.

Henderson endured what he called a “horribly slow” learning curve before playing for NYU’s pipe band. He performed at the Beacon Theatre and Madison Square Garden, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and Yankee Stadium, marching down Fifth Avenue during the city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade 14 times. Once, he performed at three venues in two boroughs across one hour.

The farthest he’s traveled was to Glasgow, where, in 2014, he finished in eighth place in Grade 4B at the World Pipe Band Championships. Three years later, he was named Saffron United’s pipe major. He reflected on the mettle tests a piper must pass along the way. During the coldest funeral he played, it was 8 degrees outside. He wore insulated gloves until the hearse arrived.

“I then dropped them like a hockey fight,” he says. “Second time through ‘Amazing Grace’ your hands feel like broken glass. So cold. Really not fun.”

The first funeral he ever played was for a 13-month-old who died from leukemia. The most recent was his mother’s, on Feb. 21, a decade after his father, Bob, was laid to rest following their 51 years of marriage.

Bob always joked about his wife’s tardiness, telling her, “Dorothy, you’re going to be late for your own funeral.” Her service was scheduled to start at 9 a.m. When John’s brother Jay arrived with her ashes at 8:59 a.m., they waited four minutes to fulfill their father’s prophesy. Henderson stood in the back of St. Mary’s Church and played her in with “Amazing Grace.” For the recessional, he performed “Oft In The Stilly Night.” The brothers wrapped their parents’ urns together with the blue shawl Dorothy wore to Bob’s funeral at their grave. Jay knelt and placed them side-by-side in the dirt.

“You become strangely comfortable with the customs,” John says.

Death surrounds him. His wife of nearly 25 years, Abby, works as a bereavement counselor at Calvary Hospital. On weekends, they walk a few blocks to Green-Wood Cemetery for fresh air and greenery. At the height of the epidemic here, they noted more smoke releases from the crematorium stacks.

She is the reason he moved to New York. They met at a speech competition in high school in Iowa, and maintained a long-distance relationship with phone calls and letter writing before he joined her in Brooklyn from Texas, where he worked for Lockheed Martin. His first job in New York was a two-week temporary position at NYU’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. He answered phones for $7.50 an hour.

AD

Now they share signs of progress. When the city’s health department announced that it was lifting restrictions on visitors at hospitals, she called it “a good day, a really good day.” She also noticed when the refrigerated truck that stored corpses in front of a funeral home by her hospital was no longer parked outside one morning. They discussed efforts to reopen the city in the wake of being ravaged by the coronavirus and roiled by unrest related to police brutality protests.

AD

“I don’t want people to die,” he said.

“I don’t want health care workers to lose their minds,” she said.

She followed him to the corner as 7 p.m. neared. He carried his pipes; she brought a purple cowbell. In front of the bar, a chalkboard greeted all comers:

Because of the covid-19 pandemic, races across the country and world have been canceled or postponed. For elite athletes who often spend nearly a year with their eyes on one big prize, this is a serious blow.

In this new reality, Kirkpatrick, Serafini, D’Amato and other elite runners must figure out a new path forward — with the mental-emotional part as significant as anything. Step one, says Denver-based sports psychologist Justin Ross, is allowing themselves to process the emotions that surround the loss of their “A” races.

AD

AD

“You have to give yourself permission to be sad,” he says. “Any major loss connected to a personal goal will have a big emotional impact.”

Justin Bosley, a board-certified sports medicine physician in the San Francisco Bay area, concurs. “Whenever I work with high-level athletes, I remind them that when an unforeseen circumstance arises that forces a change in plans, it’s okay to mourn,” he says. “You can’t move on until you process your emotions first.”

D’Amato, 35, a real estate agent from Midlothian, Va., is hoping she will have a chance to compete at her race at its new rescheduled date in October. Still, she says that her knee-jerk reaction was to find another race near the original for which she could use her hard-earned fitness.

AD

“I was excited for the opportunity and I was bummed when the situation changed,” she admits. “As I tried to find a replacement race, all those were canceling as well.”

AD

In 38-year-old Kirkpatrick’s case, the vaunted Boston race had become a big goal after she ran a disappointing Olympic marathon trials race in February.

“The trials were my ‘A’ race for a long time, but then I headed into them rundown and anemic,” she says. “I missed key workouts and took awhile to bounce back. I handled myself surprisingly well during the trials and felt strong, so I had confidence heading into Boston.”

A path forward

Bosley recommends that once runners have a chance to process the loss of all racing prospects, they choose the next best target. It “doesn’t have to be another race to be motivating,” he says. “It can be measuring progress on a favorite route, for instance.”

AD

This is something D’Amato has put into place. Recently she set a personal best in a solo effort 5K on the track. “I’m focusing on the daily and the weekly instead of a race,” she says.

AD

Serafini, 28, the community manager at clothing brand Tracksmith who had been leading a training group preparing for Boston, has already changed his outlook. “The message I’m trying to convey to my group is that right now, running is one of the only constants in our lives,” he says. “We can use it as meditation. I’ve come to enjoy the fact that I don’t have to have the foot on the gas right now.”

This approach is an emotionally healthy one, Ross says. “This is an opportunity to recognize that running provides so many other benefits beyond achieving race goals,” he says. “It gives us freedom to explore the outdoors and connect back to the reasons it matters to us.”

AD

Kirkpatrick, who lives in Colorado with plenty of outdoor space around her, is doing just that. “I have no foreseeable races, so I’m just enjoying the beauty of Colorado and taking a break from structured training,” she says. “I love running, so I don’t necessarily need a race to get me out the door. Racing is icing on the cake.”

AD

Now is a good time to get more sleep, focus on nutrition and foster a recovery mind-set, too. “Athletes are very good at using the fight-or-flight mechanism for training and competition,” Bosley says. “But it’s important to cultivate a . . . rest and recovery cycle, too.”

This might look like a string of easy runs, or one hard workout per week, for the time being. “Go slow, go fast, do whatever feels good right now, as long as it’s off a regimen,” Ross recommends. “It’s an opportunity to find that ‘flow state’ with running that’s not found when running for metrics.”

AD

The danger comes when athletes ignore that right now is a stressful time for all, and try to push through it with hard training. Stress is stress to the body — adding in hard training on top of that can lead to a drop in immunity.

AD

Serafini, for his part, is going easier right now. “I want to maintain fitness but not go over the top,” he says.

As summer progresses, along with the possibility of races getting rescheduled sometime in the future, Ross encourages athletes to take their temperature on enthusiasm.

“Don’t race because you feel you must,” he says. “Race because you are excited and have renewed purpose after this break.”

For now, Kirkpatrick is considering signing up for December’s California International Marathon, but she says she won’t get her hopes up as she had for Boston. Instead, she’ll focus on a sure bet: The local “Firecracker 5k,” which will be an invitation-only, 20-person elite field (10 men/10 women).

“They’re doing an individual time trials for each runner and film[ing] each person running the course,” she says. “On July 4, they’ll release the video and announce the winners, paying out prize money. It will be really fun.”"/['Amanda Loudin']/2020-06-26 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7O7WF5DFQ4I6VLGKQDBCXPXJN4.jpg&w=1440"

When the temperature rises, they can impair the body’s ability to cope with heat.

“Everyone who takes medications, whether they are over-the-counter or prescription, needs to consider that their medication can put them at risk once summer arrives,” says Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician and interim director of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment.

AD

AD

“Heat waves are getting worse with climate change,” Bernstein says. “We need to be mindful when medications mix with heat. Too much heat can make an otherwise safe and effective drug dangerous.”

Some medicines, such as diuretics, make our bodies lose water, which can result in dehydration when it’s hot outside. Others — such as beta blockers or ACE inhibitors — lower blood pressure, which makes fainting more likely in the heat. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors — commonly prescribed antidepressants like Prozac — can make us sweat more, also causing dehydration.

Still others — the OTC allergy drug Benadryl, for example, Cogentin, a medication for Parkinson’s disease, and Spiriva, an asthma treatment — can reduce sweating, the body’s natural cooling mechanism, which can lead to overheating and heat stroke. Finally, others — antipsychotics, for example — can hamper the brain’s ability to regulate body temperature.

AD

AD

Consumers can protect themselves by taking the same precautions as those recommended generally to prevent heat sickness. These include monitoring weather forecasts and — if you exercise outside — go out early in the morning or evening.

“If you have to be outside in the middle of the day, try to stay in shade and drink fluids,” Bernstein says, and seek medical help if you stop sweating or you begin to feel tired or sleepy, signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke.

“For many people on medications, working outside may not be a choice,” Bernstein says. “If you know you have to be outside, make sure your doctor knows your job requires you to be outside. The dose may be adjusted based on that exposure, either in terms of how much or when you take it.”

AD

Be especially vigilant if you start a new medication in the summertime, as the risk of heat reactions is higher and as the body is unaccustomed to a new drug and needs time to adjust, Bernstein says. And — most important — don’t consider halting any of your medications when it turns hot. “If you are prescribed a medication, it’s for good reason and don’t stop,” Bernstein says.

AD

Normal body temperature is about 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit, although there is a range. Some people consistently measure lower, others a bit higher. But “when your body’s ability to get rid of heat fails, your body temperature can go up very quickly, often to 103 or higher,” which is dangerous, Bernstein says.

We keep our body temperatures constant by producing and losing heat, an important balance.

AD

“When the outdoor temperature is higher than the skin temperature, the only heat loss mechanism available is evaporation, or sweating,” says Ying Zhang, senior lecturer at the University of Sydney’s School of Public Health. “Therefore, any factors that hamper evaporation, such as high humidity, reduced cardiac output, reduced air flow — or some drugs — can cause body temperature to rise, which can culminate in life-threatening heatstroke.”

AD

Few studies have examined the dangerous interaction between drugs and heat, and experts say more are needed.

“Due to the lack of research in the field, it is impossible to estimate the scale of the problem,” Zhang says. “However, it is for sure that climate change will bring more health problems due to medications. Older people will be especially vulnerable because they usually take more than one drug.”

AD

Bernstein agrees on the need for more research.

“We would be able to do much more in terms of adjusting and advice if we spent a little more time and money figuring this out,” he says.

Patients also should take care in storing their drugs because heat exposure could affect their efficacy, Bernstein says. Many drug labels contain storage instructions, although this won’t help those who need their drugs — asthma inhalers, for example — with them at all times.

AD

“I’d be surprised to learn of any medication that was completely stable when exposed to extreme heat, but, at the same time, it’s not always clear how much of an effect heat has,” Bernstein says. “We don’t know nearly enough about how keeping a medication in a purse outside on a hot day may degrade the medication inside.”

AD

As the world experiences more frequent and prolonged heat waves, it’s also important for physicians and other health professionals to become more aware of the problem, experts say.

“Medical schools don’t teach doctors about these risks, in part because the risks are new,” Bernstein says. “This is because climate change has brought unprecedented heat. People are experiencing heat unlike any in our history. In the past, we didn’t have to worry about medications and heat in the summer. But now, we do.”"/['Marlene Cimons']/2020-06-25 00:00:00/"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJHCR3FXAQI6VGQ52PNRZPQHZY.jpg&w=1440"

The particle gives others their mass, and when it was finally observed in the LHC in 2012, it confirmed a prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics. The model helps physicists understand how matter works, but until the Higgs boson was observed, it hadn’t yet been verified.

AD

AD

But though the Standard Model is the closest physics has come to explaining the nature of matter, physicists still have unanswered questions — and want to generate more Higgs boson particles and study how they work. A massive electron-positron collider could be used to pump out many Higgs particles, then study them to see whether they do what physicists predict.

Eventually, the tunnel would be repurposed to house an even more powerful proton collider than the LHC — a collider that generates so much energy it might produce new kinds of particles for physicists to study.

Mid-century may seem far off, but not if you consider how long it took to build the LHC. It took decades to plan the particle accelerator and 14 years of construction and testing before the machine was ready to run. It’s still being upgraded. The accelerator’s next run is scheduled for May 2021, and when it goes back online it will generate many more particle collisions than the LHC.

"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/26/stimulus-dead-people/"/Why the IRS should not claw back $1.4 billion in stimulus checks sent to dead people/"“We hope this payment provides meaningful support for you at this time,” said the letter signed by President Trump.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (Cares) Act provides up to a $1,200 economic impact payment for individuals and up to $2,400 for taxpayers filing a joint return. But the distribution has been beset by glitches — including checks sent to dead people.

AD

AD

The optics of sending stimulus payments to dead people didn’t look good for the administration. So, in an offhand comment on April 17, Trump said the payments should be returned. “Sometimes you send a check to somebody wrong,” Trump said in a coronavirus task force press briefing. “Sometimes people are listed, they die, and they get a check. That can happen. … We’ll get that back.”

But nobody from the IRS communicated this directly to Moore.

(The Florida widower hasn’t received a stimulus payment anyway, not for himself, nor his wife — but that’s because of a whole other series of unrelated IRS glitches, too numerous to recount here).

For many surviving spouses, adult children and estate administrators, the confusing signals have created anxiety over what to do with the payments — and the prospect that the IRS could go after people who have already spent the stimulus money.

AD

AD

Moore learned his wife wasn’t entitled to the payment only after he made half a dozen calls to the number listed in the letter bearing Trump’s signature, a document the IRS is required to send under the Cares Act. Eventually, Moore was able to reach a live IRS representative who told him he was only entitled to $1,200.

“It’s frustrating,” Moore said. “Unfortunately there is enough stress with the death of a spouse without the IRS adding more.”

To make matters worse, this misstep was entirely avoidable.

In 2013, the GAO identified weaknesses in IRS processes that allowed payments to be made to deceased individuals. The watchdog agency recommended corrective actions, which the IRS put in place. The agency is supposed to use death records to update taxpayers’ accounts to prevent improper payments.

AD

AD

But in the rush to get out the stimulus payments, this process was sidestepped.

“Bypassing this control for the economic impact payments, which has been in place for the past seven years, substantially increased the risk of potentially making improper payments to decedents,” the GAO said in its report.

In response, the IRS said on its website Friday that it has taken action to prevent future payments to dead people.

Gayle Griffith is administering the estate of a friend, who died last November.

Under the Cares Act, estates aren’t eligible for a stimulus payment. Yet, Griffith received a letter from the IRS dated May 15 indicating her friend, Joan Duprey, who had lived in Honolulu, would receive a $1,200 stimulus payment by check or a debit card. But next to Duprey’s name were the letters “DECD,” indicating the IRS knew she was deceased. The promised funds haven’t arrived yet.

AD

AD

Even with the federal deficit at an all-time high, trying to chase down $1.4 billion — a tiny percentage of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package — is futile, and unfair to the recipients, given that the IRS has a system in place that should have largely avoided sending stimulus payments to dead people in the first place.

On May 6, the IRS issued guidance about ineligible payments. To find the information, recipients had to know to go to the agency’s Economic Impact Payment Information Center page at irs.gov and navigate through the frequently asked questions. “Ineligible payment recipients who do not visit IRS’s website or do not have Internet access may not be aware of the process to return payments,” the GAO report said.

The IRS doesn’t even have a plan to directly notify ineligible recipients on how to return payments, the GAO said.

AD

AD

“If they don’t provide a timely, clear way for people to send the money back, I don’t think that’s right to approach people to get it back,” said Griffith, who says she’ll return the money if it ever appears. “Ethically, I believe it should be given back. No question in my mind. But practically, I don’t think they’ve created a situation where people can easily do that.”

With the IRS still fielding a reduced staff because of the coronavirus pandemic, their attempts to snatch back the stimulus money aren’t cost-effective. The IRS is already overwhelmed, with the tax deadline delayed until July 15. Millions of paper returns with refunds due must be processed. Tax fraudsters trying to steal a lot more than $1, 200 have to be pursued.

The agency is still trying to send legitimate stimulus payments to eligible Americans.

AD

AD

“As of today, I still haven’t received a relief check, and I’m a non-filing Social Security recipient,” said Guy Walker from Hillsdale, N.Y.

Is the IRS really going to allocate resources to track down surviving spouses or heirs to recover stimulus money the recipients honestly didn’t know they couldn’t spend?

LOS ANGELES, California –

Gwyneth Paltrow, who has been shilling garbage Goop products for years – items that have been proven multiple times to be a sham at best, and potentially life-threatening in their bad pseudoscience at worst. But her latest endeavor, Goop candles that smell like her former A-list vagina, have added a new treat for people dumb enough to buy it – the candles are giving people herpes in their nose.

Paltrow, perhaps best known for playing Robert Downey Jr.’s love interest, Pepper Potts, in the Iron Man films, has fallen to the levels of midnight pitchman over the last few years, and for some reason thought that selling candles scented specifically like her putrid pussy would be hot sellers. Somewhat confusingly, she appears to be right, as the candles are selling, but as they are made from the “natural juices” of Paltrow’s poon, they smell like her vagina, and are also causing people who burn the candle too long to contract herpes.

“I first noticed that I had a weird bump on the outside of my nose,” said Kirk Brown, who has estimated he’s spent around $2,000 on several hundreds of Paltrow’s candles. “I thought it was a pimple. It happens. After it got severe, and I started to feel the bumps in my nose, I went to the doctor. A test confirmed it was nose herpes. I didn’t even know it was possible!”

“I only burned one of her candles for a very short time,” said Melissa Rogers of Atlanta. “I got it as a gag gift from a co-worker at Christmastime. It smelled horrendous; like a cross between stale pee and the cheese you scrape out of an infected vagina. I was not a fan. I became less of a fan when it became clear that I was getting nose herpes. It’s hugely embarrassing.”

Multiple people say they have had similar experiences, and a lawyer has been contacted in at least one of the cases in hopes of a class-action suit. Reps for Gwyneth Paltrow’s vagina could not be reached for comment.

LOS ANGELES, California –

Gremlins star Gizmo has filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles superior court against Disney over their latest viral property, “Baby Yoda,” also known as The Child, from the hit Disney+ series The Mandalorian. Gizmo claims that Disney stole his likeness when they created the cute, cuddly character.

“My client is clearly the basis for the new Disney character affectionately known as Baby Yoda, and designers at Disney knew exactly what they were doing when they developed The Child’s final form,” said lawyer Chris Dante, who is representing Gizmo. “We are seeking damages for the extreme distress, loss of work, and emotional turmoil that Baby Yoda has caused my client. I am confident we have a strong case.”

Lawyers for Disney could not be reached for comment, but an anonymous employee who works on The Mandalorian said that there were draft notes that indicated Disney executives “very much” wanted to have a new character that “was 50% Yoda, 50% Gizmo, and 100% adorable.”

Gizmo first rose to fame in 1984 with his starring role in the Christmas-themed horror film Gremilins.

MIAMI, Florida –

A woman in Florida says she got pregnant on a business trip to Boston last month, claiming that the hotel never changed the sheets on the bed, and there must have been “ejaculate” on them.

Penny Simon, 28, travelled to Boston for a sales convention, and said that the Hilton she stayed at was “super dirty,” and even though she complained, she thinks they didn’t change the sheets on her bed, and that semen left in the bed from a previous visitor got her pregnant.

“It’s crazy, really, and I feel so bad for her,” said Chris Simon, 29, Penny’s husband. “She’s very conflicted. We’re not an abortion household, but at the same time, the baby isn’t mine, and she’s saying she doesn’t know what to do. I really don’t want to raise another man’s child, but we’ve been trying for 4 years to get pregnant, and she hasn’t been able to. I will raise this baby as my own if that’s what God wants. I just hope the hotel knows that we are suing them for mental anguish. This is disgusting!”

Empire News spoke to Mary Rogers, who works the front desk at the Hilton in Boston where Penny stayed.

“The rooms are very clean, and this hotel was only a week old at the time the guest you mentioned stayed,” said Rogers. “No one had ever been in that room before. Although I was on staff the two nights Ms. Simon stayed here, and watched her bring up at least 3 different men from the hotel bar over the course of 4 hours, so if I had to guess how she got pregnant, I think that answers it.”

MIAMI, Florida –

The Ringling Brothers circus, which is often full of magic, illusion, laughter, and fun, also features daring acts such as the trapeze artists, a favorite of crowds throughout the world.

What was not expected by the audience, children or adults, is that in the middle of the show, one of the trapeze artists, a young girl, suffered a fateful and irreversible intestinal problem. “I’m watching the show, and everything is beautiful and amazing, and then all of a sudden, everything happened at once,” said Mark Ryan, who was in the audience with his 2-year-old son. “It’s raining shit, let’s get out of here, run away! Everyone was yelling and screaming. Dozens of people got covered in shit. It was absolutely disturbing. We definitely requested a ticket to return at a later date. Totally uncalled for.”

Ringling Brothers said that through their entire history, this was the first such issue with any of their performers, outside of the animals, shitting on a customer.

STAMFORD, CT –

WWE CEO and Chairman Vince McMahon announced today that he had met with Tony Khan, the owner of new wrestling promotion AEW, and that the two had agreed on a purchase amount, with McMahon becoming sole owner.

“When I saw the kind of wrestling that these guys were doing, the matches they were putting on, the crowd reactions – I knew that this was something big, and I had to get involved,” said McMahon. “If I didn’t try to take control of this company now, they’d likely have overshadowed the WWE within a few years, maybe less. I am too old for more Monday Night Wars.”

McMahon is referencing the fan’s term for the ratings battle between the WWE and the then Ted Turner owned WCW. During the mid-90s, the two companies went head to head on Monday evenings in prime time TV slots. When WWE eventually took control of the ratings, McMahon bought out WCW and folded the entire promotion.

“When McMahon approached me, I laughed at first,” said Tony Khan, a billionaire whose family has long ties in the world of sports. “But he came in with a price that was just outrageous, and I would have been a fool to say no. Yes, I’m worth upwards of 4 times what the WWE is worth, but I didn’t get that way by being a fool. I’m a wrestling fan, and I love what we’re doing, but WWE can take what we’re doing and amp it up globally overnight.”

On news of the purchase, AEW’s Executive Vice President, Cody Rhodes, simply said “Fuck. Not again.”

CHARLOTTE, North Carolina –

The NFL has officially signed off on a name change request from the Carolina Panthers franchise, allowing the team to move forward with becoming the Carolina Black Panthers. The name request was submitted during the off-season, with NFL officials deliberating on the option.

“We decided to let them go ahead and change the name, as well as the logo,” said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. “We understand their reasoning – after all, the team is made up of predominantly African-American players – and we cannot see any reason why this name change would cause any issues.

The new Black Panthers say that they will finish the season with their current attired and logos, and plan for a switch during the 2019 season.

“We are very happy with the decision to allow this,” said team owner Mario Lewis. “I mean, I’m not a black guy, but I think it’s a very powerful statement. I know tons of black people, some of my best friends are black. So this is my way of supporting them, and supporting this team. We really hope that this will bring the fans together, and show them that singular differences are always the most important.”

RUSSIA –

As the World Cup championship gets underway, the TV ratings for the sport have dwindled to record lows, with only approximately 1 out of every 3 million homes tuning in. Despite marketing the event all over the world, FIFA has said they are “really upset” by the numbers.

“We depend on people to watch the games from home, because the ad revenue is what we live off of the next 4 years before the next Cup,” said spokesman Ron Pele. “The ad revenue this year, we’re…well, it’s beans and franks the next four years. No one is watching.”

“Honestly, I only ever watched the Cup because it’s all the was on before I had cable,” said former soccer fan Mario Bluth. “Now that I have Netflix and stuff, why the hell would I watch soccer? They’re a bunch of pussies.”

Numbers outside of the United States and Canada have also dwindled to record lows, with FIFA saying that it’s possible they may need to cancel TV presentation of future events.

“This TV time isn’t cheap, and sponsors are calling us with threats to pull ads left and right,” said Pele. “This is really, really bad for the sport of soccer. Or Football. Whatever you call it. Who cares?”

At a press conference at the White House today, President Trump announced that he would be the next cover star for EA Sports’ PGA Tour video game series. The series will be branded as Donald Trump’s PGA Tour.

From The Hard Times:

“This is a tremendous honor that I’ve bestowed upon myself,” said Trump to a crowded White House press room. “I’ve got the best clubs, I play on the best courses, I’m like, really great at golf. Putting the Trump brand on this game is going to boost sales, bigly.”

Casey Patrick, a lead developer on PGA Tour 18, nervously echoed the president’s sentiments while flanked on each side by Secret Service members.

“After the Secret Service kicked our door in, slammed my head on a desk, and forced me to sign a contract that appeared to be written in crayon by President Trump himself, we were thrilled to put him on the cover,” Patrick told a group of reporters."/['Bob The Empire News Potato']//"https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pga.jpg"

BOSTON, MA

Over a dozen people were hospitalized and 11 people were arrested after a massive celebration broke out in the streets of Boston on Friday.

Last week, conservative dickbag Rush Limbaugh announced he had late-stage lung cancer, and liberals across the country let out a massive cheer. In Boston, a public celebration took place during the afternoon on Friday, with an estimated 35,000 people in attendance outside of Fenway Park.

“When I heard that Rush was going to die, I couldn’t wait to celebrate,” said Rick Baker, 39, of Boston. “If there were ever a more worthless, piece of shit, talking head on radio and TV, I don’t know who it is. I heard about the party on the radio Friday morning, called out of work, and headed down to the park to party.”

Boston Police Department say that the gathering was not authorized, but they caught wind of the party on social media, and were able to send a “significant number of police officers” to the area to keep things under control.

“We were able to keep things really under control under the conservative protestors showed up,” said Boston Police Chief Frank R. Green. “The people who were there to enjoy the celebration were great. Unfortunately, some Rush supporters spoiled the fun. In the end, we arrested multiple people and our police forces had to, sadly, beat down many protestors who did not listen to directions to vacate the area.”

Green said that none of the “Rushers” had life-threatening injuries, and that most would be out of the hospital within a few days.

“Next time, perhaps these people will listen,” said Green. “If a group of people want to celebrate the inevitable death of a world class piece of shit, we will support that. If you want to get in the way of that, we will ensure that you’re dealt with accordingly.”

Rush Limbaugh, who for some stupid reason received the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week, ensuring that it is now 100% meaningless, could not be reached for comment.

WASHINGTON, D.C.

President Trump has decided to throw a massive “I Beat Impeachment” party at the White House, which is slated to kickoff around 6PM on Saturday, with plans to run until the early morning hours on Monday.

“This is going to be the biggest, and best event that the White House has ever seen,” said President Trump. “When you’re the best, you want to have the best parties, and invite the best celebrities, and it’s going to be huge. Just huge. I’m very excited to have people join me for this mega-rager.”

Trump went on to say that several celebrity guests were scheduled to appear, including Eli Manning, Rush Limbaugh, Ted Nugent, and a “variety of Playboy Playmates” from the last several years.

“Oh man, the amount of planning this has taken is immense,” said a White House staffer who preferred to stay anonymous. “When the President parties, it’s a big deal. We need to include a barrage of cocaine and alcohol to keep the guests happy, and I’ll tell you right now – if you think the impeachment was a waste of taxpayer money, the cost of this party is going to put that to shame.”

Musical guests scheduled to perform include Kanye West, Dire Straits, and The Jesus and Mary Chain.

MEXICO CITY, Mexico –

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the parent company of Corona brands of beer, has announced they are filing suit against the Chinese government, after the massive Coronavirus scare in that country has caused a mass panic and multiple deaths. AB InBev claims that the bad press of deaths, mixed with the satiric natures of internet memes connecting “coronavirus” with Corona beers has caused them a loss of tens of millions of dollars.

“Anheuser-Busch InBev feels that the Chinese government is solely responsible for putting the bad taste in people’s mouths regarding the name Corona,” said AB InBev spokesman Rick Barker. “The lack of their medical care, the lack of their preparation, has lead to a massive outbreak of the Coronavirus in China, and as such, has lead to a massive souring of our brand here in the United States.”

The lawsuit, which claims nearly $200 million in damages, was filed in a superior court in Beijing, and names several specific government officials and medical personnel.

“While Corona beer has never been particularly popular in the United States with anyone, outside of those who hate the taste of good beer so prefer swill that you have to add fruit to in order to drink it, but that’s not the point,” said Barker. “We are already feeling the pinch of this Coronavirus, and sales figures are dwindling daily. It’s only a matter of time before the connection becomes a total mixture of truth and reality, and people stop drinking Coronas all together because they think they’ll get sick from it. They will, but that’s because it’s garbage beer, not because it’s got any virus in it.”

PHILADELPHIA, PA

Former President Barack Obama announced late last night that he had filed for divorce from his wife of 27 years, Michelle Obama, after he revealed a secret double life as a homosexual.

“It is with a bit of sadness and a whole lot of relief that I announce that Michelle and I have decided to separate, as I have admitted to her, as I’m doing now to the rest of the world, that I am a homosexual,” said Barack Obama. “This may come as a shock to many, and anger others, but this is my personal business, and I would hope that everyone could respect my privacy at this time”

Representatives for Michelle Obama said that she and the former president would split amicably, and that Michelle herself was “not particularly shocked” by the revelation.

“We are very close, as close as two people could ever be, really,” said Michelle in a prepared statement. “I’ve known for many years about Barack’s secret life, and I fully support him in the direction that his life takes him. He was and is an incredible leader, a loving father and family man, and now he can go on to make some other guy, or multiple guys, very happy.”

“Honestly, I was prepared to just stay with her,” said Barack. “I think she’s secretly know for years that I was gay, and since it already came out in every conservative news site years ago that Michelle was actually born a man, I figured that was close enough. I was prepared to stick it out and keep having young guys on the side. Michelle nixed it, though. She said if this was going to become public news, then there’s no reason we shouldn’t just split up and reveal our true selves. Whoops, I guess I just proved those rumors about her secret to be true, too. Damn, sorry Michelle!”

Representatives for the Obama children, Malia and Sasha, could not be reached for comment, but their Facebook pages both were vacant of any comments on the split.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

In what most are calling a “backroom deal,” President Trump has struck an arrangement with Amazon, Netflix, Disney, Wayfair, and other major companies in the United States, where they will not have to pay any taxes at all, regardless of income.

The purpose of the deal, according to insiders, is to ensure the “continuation and expansion of commerce and entertainment in the United States.”

“If Netflix makes $100 million dollars in profit, just as an example, should they be forced to pay 85% of that in taxes?” said President Trump in a completely unprepared statement. “Of course not, they need money to continue growing their company, and growing their output of amazing shows. That’s what is important when ti comes to the growth of this country. That’s how we’re going to continue to Make America Great Again.”

MIAMI, Florida –

A young boy in Florida has being hospitalized after his brand new Apple AirPod earphones allegedly exploded in his ear.

Caleb Mitchell, 8, has been hospitalized with 2nd degree burns on his face and inside of his ears after his Airpods exploded. According to Mitchell’s parents, the young boy is lucky to be alive, but is not out of the woods yet.

“I can’t believe something like this could happen,” said Josiah Mitchell, a standup comedian and the boy’s father. “I didn’t think they could get hot or explode or anything like that. Yet hear we are. Get it? Hear? Because Caleb is pretty much deaf now. Oh shit, I crack myself up.”

Caleb supposedly always had his Airpods in his ear, other than the times where he was charging them. He would even sleep with them, and wear them even when not listening to music. “Airpod owners are obsessed” says Candice James, a therapist, “Airpod owners really think they’re hot shit because their headphones don’t have wires. Wow, you’re so cool. Fucking losers. I just feel bad for the boy here because his parents indoctrinated him into wanting these in the first place.”

As Caleb is recovering, technology experts warn Airpod owners to not use them so much.

“Just throw them out,” said tech expert Lee Xiu, “You’ll be a better person, Airpod owners are annoying.”

PALM BEACH, Florida –

The U.S. government warn of three cases in Florida of people affected by the so-called “mosquito chirulí,” able to make a woman pregnant with just a single bite. The cases have been located in Miami, Tallahassee, and Palm Beach. and those affected have been quarantined while the cases are investigated.

The existence of this mosquito was known at the end of 2016 in Uganda and Kenya, but never before have there been cases outside these countries. It is a mosquito that has mutated and is able to impregnate a women via a very specific set of circumstances, one that requires no sperm to fertilize the ovum in fertile women. There is information that this mosquito has been responsible for more than 2,000 pregnancies in Africa.

It is unknown how it was possible for the “chirulí mosquito” to reach the United States, but the authorities are already taking the necessary measures to prevent more cases from occurring. An appeal is made to all women of childbearing age who feel the bite of a mosquito to go immediately to their doctor to receive the Plan B, morning after pill.

MIAMI, Florida –

A Florida man was taken to a Miami hospital after reportedly getting a large, D-cell battery stuck in his anus. The man claimed that he thought that the battery might give him the “energy boost” he would need to get through the rest of his day at work.

Doctors were able to extract the battery without seriously invasive surgery, but warned that putting things into your anus can “cause serious, irreparable harm.”

“This man, Joe Kennedy, who asked not to be publicly named, is very lucky,” said Dr. Frank Grates, the surgeon who extracted the battery. “He certainly could have done a lot worse. Thankfully, in this case, he went larger, and it was easy to grab. Had he gone with an AAA battery or something, and we might still be digging around in his colon.”

BOSTON, Mowsachusetts –

A group of cat scientists in Boston say that they have come to the scientific conclusion that cats are better than dogs in “every conceivable way,” and that their research is to be published in the Feline Journal of Medicine in the October issue.

“See, when it comes to pets, people generally only have two choices,” said Dr. Mow Furball, a cat scientist at UCLA who lead the team in Boston. “They get a dog, or they get a cat. Yes, you can get birds or other animals as pets, but birds are bullshit, and you damn well know it. So the choice is clearly dog or cat.”

Dr. Furball says that although many people own dogs because they think they’re a better animal, the real answer has always been cat.

“You cannot possibly think a dog is better than a cat after you see our research,” said Dr. Fluffy McCaterstein. “Dogs need to be walked. You have to take them out every few hours on their own. You can’t leave them home for more than a day by themselves or they’ll eat the couch. Frankly, dogs are stupid. Cats on the other hand, are now scientifically proven to be better pets.”

The research conducted by the team is currently “classified,” but notes will be available in the journal’s release.

BOSTON, Massachusetts –

A Boston man, Arnold Richardson, said he didn’t know what to do when his dentist told him that he was going to need a new set of custom dentures to replace the ones he’s had the last 10 years.

“I was really put out, I can’t afford that kind of thing on my salary,” said Richardson, 46, a carpenter in the South End of Boston. “I really felt lost.”

Richardson said that he scoped out the internet for the best deals, and was surprised to find a set of dentures on the shopping website/app called Wish, which sells items at highly discounted rates, occassionally knock-offs, but almost always shipped from China.

“I was hesitant, honestly, because you hear about toys and other items coming from China and they’ve been painted with old, lead-ridden paint or something like that, but really, it was all I could afford.”

After waiting 6-8 weeks for his dentures, Richardson said he was “very surprised” to find that they fit perfectly, and even more surprised that when he put them in his mouth, he automatically began speaking Chinese.

“这篇文章和我们所有的文章一样, 都是假的,” said Richardson. “如果你明白了, 那就太好了。与你认识的每个人分享!永远记住不要在网上上当废话”

CONCORD, New Hampshire

On Saturday evening at approximately 6 p.m., a mysterious light took over the skies in major US cities across the East Coast. People in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and even parts of New York reported seeing a blue or green object streaking through the sky. Social media went crazy as well as news stations as people tried to figure out what was happening.

NASA reported on Twitter that the sighting was a result of a U.S. Navy test: “Light seen in OC sky was confirmed through John Wayne Airport tower to be a Naval test fire off the coast. No further details.”

On Sunday, police in several Eastern states had received nearly 845 missing persons reports of people who have just “disappeared.” 95% of the missing people reported by Sunday evening were women between the ages of 18 – 23. Police are saying they cannot confirm that the incident on Saturday evening has any connection to the missing persons reported.

“What happened on Saturday evening in California has nothing to do with the amount of people that have gone missing since then,” said Detective Ron Alvarez of the New Hampshire Missing Persons Bureau. “It was a missile that everyone saw on Saturday and that is that. It has been confirmed by the Federal Aviation Administration as a missile, and people need to leave it just as that. In the meantime, we are doing everything we can to find the people that are missing.”

Conspiracy theorists are not convinced by the government’s explanation of the enigmatic light after photos surfaced of strange, unknown creatures found dead in fields Western Maine. These theorists say that as quickly as these photos appear on Facebook, they are taken down.

BOSTON, Massachusetts –

New Englanders, get ready. Although the snow and extremely cold temperatures have come quick this year, things are about to take a turn.

According to NOAA, a series of extreme winter storms are brewing off the coast, with all of them expected to hit most of New England by the middle of next week. The storms, dubbed “nor’easters” because of the direction they travel, will bring over ten feet of wet, packed snow between Tuesday and Thursday.

“I don’t want to go on record and say this is unprecedented, but it’s pretty close,” said NOAA weather researcher Mark Henry. “To get that much snow in such a small window of time is going to be hell for many people. Plus, because of the type of snow, we can expect massive and long-lasting power outages. It will be heavy and wet and packed, and downed trees and power lines will be almost a guarantee. This is absolutely the worst storm I’ve ever seen brewing in over 35 years as a weather researcher.”

Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts are already calling for a state of emergency, and plow crews from nearby states and Canada are already being prepared to help with the storm.

“This is going to be the Big One,” said Henry. “Everyone get that bread and milk from the store – you’re going to need it.”

FLORENCE, Italy –

Former President Barack Obama has announced his bid to become Italy’s newest Prime Minister. After discovering that Italian law did not dictate that the leader of the country must be a citizen, Obama stated that he had plans that would “directly lead to his election” as Italy’s Prime Minister.

“Italy has had 17 Prime Ministers in almost as many years, and it’s pathetic,” said Obama in a statement to the Italian people via ITV News. “In 8 years, I turned America from a depressed, Bush-era country into the thriving, amazing place it is today. If the Italian people go to the polls and write me in, I can do for your country what I did for mine.”

While there are several candidates currently running for the position, the Italian people are extremely divided on the ballots, and it’s likely that no leader will be chosen in the election. At that point, the existing sitting government can choose any person that the like, even if that person is not a citizen, and/or not a current member of government.

“I’d like to also tell the sitting government that I will work just as hard for the Italians as I did for the Americans,” said Obama. “There is no doubt in my mind that my leadership abilities will outshine anyone else you have running currently.”

"https://empirenews.net/rocketman-and-dotard-agree-to-settle-diplomatic-issues-in-epic-rap-battle/"/Rocketman And Dotard Agree To Settle Diplomatic Issues In EPIC Rap Battle/"0

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had some choice words for US President Donald Trump Friday, accusing the American leader of “mentally deranged behavior.” He went on to say, “He is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician,” Mr. Kim said.

Mr. Trump on Friday responded with some name-calling of his own. On Twitter, the president called Mr. Kim “obviously a madman.”

Trump has repeatedly said that, “the time for talk is over,” and has proposed what is being called a radical diplomatic solution. Epic rap battle. As both leaders enjoy talking smack, and nuclear war would obliterate the human race, this is being hailed as the perfect solution.

Initially Kim Jong Un proposed a wrestling match, but Trump backed down after hearing the rumor Kim Jong Un is a champion ssireum wrestler. Ssireum is a folk wrestling style and traditional national sport of Korea. While it is likely this is yet another one of Kim Jong Un’s unsubstantiated claims about his physical prowess, advisors warned Trump that at 71, nearly twice the age of North Korea’s leader, this was potentially a game he would not win.

Although North Korea’s leader taunted Trump for backing down from the wrestling match, calling him a “frightened dog,” he accepted Trump’s suggestion to rap battle, saying he would “annihilate the senile, dotard, American snake bastard.”

Critics worry Trump’s repertoire of racist slurs and “yo momma” jokes will not be enough to win the rap battle, but Trump is confident his old white guy swagger will prevail. “Rocketman ain’t got nothin’ on me,” he said in a recent tweet. Still, by coming up with an epic dis like Dotard, Kim Jong Un has demonstrated his masterful use of antiquated language and shown he knows his way around a thesaurus. Trump’s straightforward style may cost him points in the creativity category, as so far the best insults he has delivered include nicknames such as, Crooked Hillary, Lyin’ Ted, Crazy Bernie, and Low Energy-Jeb. “Cryin’ Chuck” and “Rocketman” do show he is capable of alliteration and ripping off Elton John songs though, so he may be able to pull it off.

A date for the competition has yet to be set, but ample time will be given to allow each leader to prepare dope rhymes . The rap battle will be judged by a panel of hip hop artists including Ice Cube, Big Baby Ghandy, Kang Chun-hyok, and Yang Dong-geun.

BAZOS, Croatia –

A team of explorers who have been searching for the lost city of Atlantis for the better part of 30 years have reportedly discovered the ruins of the Mecca, located approximately 30 miles beneath the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, directly off the coast of Croatia.

According to the research team, there is more than $300 billion worth of lost treasures within the city, not to mention the city itself.

“People have been searching for Atlantis for hundreds of years, with many thinking that it may never have existed at all,” said Mark Kempf, lead of the expedition. “Through hundreds of hours of research in books before setting out on our trip, we were able to locate the approximate area where we believed the city to be, and after repeated attempts to reach the area, we were finally successful last week.”

Kempf says that it will become “increasingly difficult” to have many people visit the area, as he believes the more people that know the area, the fewer treasures there will be.

“Oh, the place will definitely be overrun with pirates very quickly, which is why we are not releasing the city’s exact location at this time,” said Kempf. “This discovery will definitely put my children’s children’s children through college, though.”

MOBILE, Alabama —

With gay marriage now legal in all 50 states and rainbow flags (the universal symbol for gay pride) flying all over the country, one man who makes it a point to destroy every rainbow flag and spray paint over rainbow bumper stickers he sees, now wants to destroy actual rainbows.

“I used to like seeing a rainbow in nature, ” Buddy Jones told Confederate News. “Now all I see is a symbol for faggotry. Makes me sick to my tummy to see a rainbow in the sky. I want to destroy them because they’re making me crazy and I think destroying rainbows will really get on queer’s nerves, but I don’t know how to kill rainbows myself.”

That’s where Jones wants scientists to step in and help.

“I know a lot of scientists are fag sympathizers,” Jones said. “But there are some good Christian scientists out there who could use their scientific smarts to destroy rainbows. Scientists can build talking robots and send people into deep space, how hard could it be to destroy rainbows?”

Jones is calling out scientists to take up his rainbow destroying cause.

“Maybe scientists could build a laser gun that instantly blows up rainbows,” Jones said. ‘I don’t know. I just think this is an important cause. Queers took rainbows from us and made them their own, now we gotta show them there are consequences to what they did. And think about this: How long before some other sicko group takes something cool from nature? Like clouds or something. We gotta destroy rainbows now.”

Dear Allison,

It was my 21st birthday a couple days ago. The ONLY thing I asked my Nana for was a pair of diamond earrings. I don’t know how I should feel because I found out they are cubic zirconium. My stepmother pointed it out yesterday, and thinking about it, I cried on the way to work. I don’t know if I should say something. I don’t want to sound like a spoiled brat, but it was the only thing I asked for. Should I mention it? I really want to say something.

-Faked Out

Dear Faked,

Aww, poor you. Too late, you already sound like a spoiled brat. 21? Nana is wise enough to know you’ll lose an earring during one of your many drunk night – most likely while you’re going down on a stranger with an STD who picked you up while you were blacked out at the bar. What are you, a rich bitch? It’s time to grow up and realize Nana’s bank account doesn’t revolve around you. Whatever your job is, it isn’t hard enough. You should try mining your own diamond for a bowl of gruel a day.

But then again, I’m not really the person to ask since my own mother would’ve slapped me if I had the balls to ask for diamonds. Maybe you should buy yourself a bunch of booze and get the courage to call your Nana. I’m sure if you whine enough she’ll get you a much better present next year.



Dear Allison,

I am torn between my 16 year-old daughter, “Uniquea” and my bae, “Tyrone”. My fiancé got me a stuffed monkey for my birthday a couple weeks ago. Wellllllll…afterwards we got in a fight, and he wanted it back. I told him no, cuz he gave that to me. Anyway, he comes over to get it, and we got in another altercation over it. After we had it out, he apologized and started kissin’ up on me. My daughter screamed, she sick of him hustlin’ me and after kissin’ on me like it was a’ight. Then she took his Ray-Bans and ran in the other room. I screamed at her to give ‘em back, but she twisted them ‘till they was broke beyond repair. Tyrone insists Uniquea needa pay for them out of her hair/nail allowance, but I say Tyrone shouldn’t of been over here provokin’ in the first place. Should I side with my man or my daughter?

-Hassled at Home

Dear Hassled,

Your fiancé sounds like quite the catch. I bet the moment you don’t put out, he demands you give him all those cheesy “I Luv You” Valentine’s teddy bears that line your headboard. Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter what you do. You’re screwed. You’re daughter’s screwed. It doesn’t matter if Tyrone is in your life because you’re all cursed to live an ignorant, drama-filled existence, regardless. Continue modeling that kind of behavior and just pray Uniquea’s first baby isn’t doesn’t end up with as God-awful a name as she did and that her baby-daddy actually pays child support.

DEAR ALLISON,

How do I know if the man I married is really “the one?” My husband and I have been married for 2 years. He does everything for me. He works three jobs so I can stay home and build my small business. He cooks, and cleans. He’s fantastic in bed. We are doing really well…but there is something that’s just missing. What if I made a mistake?

– CONCERNED in CALIFORNIA

Dear Concerned,

The man sounds like a saint. To be honest, I don’t think he probably is the one for you. If anything, he sounds like the one for me. After the string of losers I’ve been with, I could use a man who knows how to cook, how to clean, and how to do me right. Tell you what, Concerned – you let him go. If he comes back, then he’s “the one.” If you find him in my bed, then it looks like he was the one, but you’re too stupid to have known it. You’re living every woman’s dream, and you’re thinking it might have been a mistake? You must be a lesbian.



DEAR ALLISON,

For my 18th birthday my boyfriend got me a tattoo, but I didn’t tell my parents. I still live at home, and my Dad will FREAK OUT if he knows that I got “Chris Forever” tattooed on my thigh. How do I tell my parents that I got inked?

– TATTED in TALLAHASSE

Dear Tatted,

First off, the fact that you’re barely 18 and you got your boyfriend’s name tattooed on you already screams how dumb you are. There are people who have been married decades who don’t do stupid things like that. My suggestion would be to tell your parents as soon as possible, and hope they forgive you enough to help pay to have it lasered off. The only name you should put on your body is your child’s. Hell, you shouldn’t even put that. Get a damn flower or a heart like every other teenage idiot out there, and call it a day. Since I got this letter 2 weeks ago, I’d assume that Chris has already left you for some other bimbo. Now you get to spend the rest of your life dating only men named Chris, or else they’re going to go limp as soon as you take your pants off.



DEAR ALLISON,

My mother is a die-hard Christian, and on more than one occasion has made it quite known to me, my family, and everyone else who will listen that she hates gay people, and thinks they are an abomination. I’m 23 now, and I’m afraid to come out of the closet for fear I will lose my mother’s love. What do I do?

-IN THE CLOSET in INDIANAPOLIS

Dear Closet,

Man up, my gay friend. If your mother is such a bigot that she would disown her child because of their sexual orientation, than you don’t need her! Find a new mom. Find a mate, and have their mom be your new mom! There are plenty of people out there who will accept you for who you are. It will probably be hard at first to tell your mother, but if she can’t handle it, then how is she going to handle when you find a mate? Get married? Adopt children? In my opinion, your mother needs to grow the hell up and deal. It’s 2014 for crying out loud. How much longer are we going to have to deal with these conservative bigots? Listen, you tell your mom that she’s going to have to accept you, or you smack that bitch in the face. No two ways about it. Good luck!

DEAR ALLISON,

Sometimes I think my step-mother really holds me back from having any fun. If I ask her if it’s okay to go to movies with friends, she won’t let me unless I do something for her, like the dishes or mow the lawn or any number of other household chores. I am the only one that she makes do this – my two step-brothers and my step-sister get to go out and do whatever they want. Why does she make me do things but they never have to?

-CRYING in COLORADO

Dear Crying,

You don’t have to be such a crybaby, you know. Just do the damn dishes, and then you can go hang out with friends or go to the movies. Your step-mother is letting her kids do things without “paying her” for them because they are the fruit of her loins. Since you were ejected from some other woman’s lovehole, she’s more than likely making you pay for it. No step-mother has ever liked her step-children. Haven’t you ever seen Cinderella? Your best bet is to hurry up and turn 18, so you can tell her exactly where to go, and exactly how to get there.

DEAR ALLISON,

I hate it when people spoil the endings of my favorite TV shows or movies I haven’t seen on social media. Simple question, but how do I get people to stop talking about things before I see them?!

-UGH in UTAH

Dear Ugh,

First, let me congratulate you on coming up with the worst damn pseudonym that I’ve ever seen. “Ugh?” Oh God, you must be 12. Anyway, this might come as a surprise to you, but you could, you know, get the hell off the internet once in a while. You could also stop worrying about TV and movies getting spoiled for you, because they’re just entertainment, and if knowing who died on last night’s episode of Game of Thrones before you’ve had a chance to watch it is ruining your life, I think you’re going to have much, much bigger problems in life the older you get. Good luck in life, Ugh. You’re definitely going to need it.

DEAR ALLISON,

I got married last week, and my mother-in-law got completely hammered drunk at the wedding. Long story short, she ended up hitting on my still-very-married father. It made my mother extremely upset, and now my husband’s family and my family will have nothing to do with each other. What can I do to reconcile this whole ordeal?

-TOASTED in TULSA

Dear Toasted,

Who cares if your families can’t get along? Do they really have to have anything to do with each other? My husband hasn’t spoken to my side of the family since the wedding four years ago, and he’s never been happier. In case you didn’t know this, in-laws have never gotten along with their son or daughter’s significant other. Or you could play it the complete opposite way and try and get your parents divorced so you can hook up your father and mother-in-law. It could be one big, happy family. It’s really your call. Either way, people do stupid things when drunk. If your mother doesn’t know that, she must be a complete and total stick in the ass…or mud. Whatever floats your boat.

"https://empirenews.net/go-ask-allison-i-think-my-boyfriends-cheating-please-help/"/Go Ask Allison: I Think My Boyfriend’s Cheating. Please Help!/"0

DEAR ALLISON,



My boyfriend of 4 years and I have been seeing each other less and less lately, as I recently started a new job. When I come home to him at night, he seems withdrawn and doesn’t enjoy having…well, we’re not as intimate as we used to be. He’s not working and I pay all the bills, so I don’t think he’s stressed out or anything. I don’t want to be that bitchy girlfriend who goes through his Facebook or his phone to see if he’s been talking to other girls, but I think he might be cheating. Should I confront him, or go about finding out another way?

– SUSPICIOUS in SACRAMENTO

Dear Suspicious,

Of course he’s cheating on you. The only thing a man wants more than a good steak is a good ol’ fashioned. If you are coming home from a long day at work, and he’s been lounging around all day and it’s him that doesn’t want you, there really is no other explanation. I’d suggest that you “be that bitchy girlfriend” and go through his phone or Facebook. You don’t want to confront him, because what’s the point? Is he just going to say “oh, you’re right, dear, I’m cheating.”? No, he’s going to deny it. Your best course of action is to wait until he’s asleep and smell his penis. It sounds crude, but everyone knows men rarely wash themselves period, and the odds of him showering after having his mistress over is zero. Definitely sniff that shaft, and you’ll have all the evidence you need.

DEAR ALLISON,

My girlfriend of two years is lazy and doesn’t wanna do anything for me. In my circle, the other girlfriends will make food for the game, and then go off and do their own thing, but they always come out to see if we need more beer or snacks, you know? My girlfriend doesn’t do those things, and it’s embarassing. My bros, they give me crap about how lazy she is. When we watch the game at my house, she doesn’t wanna cook, and then she sits around, trying to talk through the game. Like we’re interested in listening to her long, boring stories about shoes? The other day I was checking out my buddy’s girlfriend’s ass as she bent over to pick up our beer cans, and I thought – “that’s what I deserve.” I’m wondering if I should break up with her because this isn’t working, and it’s not like I don’t have other options.

– FED-UP in FREEPORT

Dear FED-UP,

Start packing her bags right now – I can’t believe you’ve dealt with her for two years! By this point she should definitely know her place. If she isn’t going to make you a sandwich and sit quietly during the game, or let you go out with your bros without nagging, then she isn’t the one. Look at your buddies; sounds like they’ve got their women trained perfectly! There are plenty of girls out there who have learned their lessons, so just choose one of the dumb sluts you’re probably already flirting with, and plug her hard. After you’ve gotten your ex out of the way, make sure you tell the new girl how much you love the cheese dip your buddy’s girlfriend always brings over, and set the expectation that that’s what you expect out of your woman. Out of desperation to please you, she’ll learn to jump right up at the sound of a crushed beer can, or you can tell her where to go, too.

DEAR ALLISON,

I hate my mother. She has the mentality of an extremely spoiled teenager in the body of an overweight, pushy fifty year-old troll. She is in complete denial about all the abuse she put me through when I was growing up. She says that everything bad in her life is my fault, and she’s posted nasty stuff to my Facebook wall, like telling me that she wishes I was never born. It’s got so bad that I had to block her. She still continues to spread rumors to my friends and family, saying that I pawned her jewelry for drugs or that I’ve prostituted myself for spare change. These lies hurt, because my family and friends are now ostracizing me. I’ve never even had sex, and she knows it! Every time we talk, it’s a blow out. Should I try to reconcile with her, or should I just move on with my life?

-MISERABLE in MALIBU

DEAR MISERABLE,

Judging by your letter, I’d say you and your mother have more in common than you think! You must be extremely spoiled yourself. Here you are calling your mother nasty things in a massive public setting, just like you say she’s done to you! Way more people will see your letter here, calling your mother a fat troll, than the minimal amount of friends and family members who she no doubt has on her Facebook page. How do you think she’s going to feel when she sees your letter here? Yeah, probably the same way you felt when she called you a little whore. Your family probably doesn’t want to talk to you anymore because you’re the worst kind of bitch – the kind who blames everyone else around her for her own shortcomings. Plus, they probably know you’ll steal their valuables for drug money next! Go to counseling with your mother. You both sound like a couple of nut jobs.

PHILADELPHIA, PA –

Michelle Obama, the wife of former president Barack Obama, has announced that she will be running for president in the 2020 election.

“I know I’m a lot later than most people, but to be honest, there’s no reason to start running 2 years before the election,” said Michelle Obama from the family home in Philadelphia. “It’s much easier to wait until the ‘little people’ drop out, and we can see what’s left of the field. At this point, the field is pretty bland, so I’m going to come in and mow it down.”

Obama, who was highly involved in education and children’s health during her husband’s two terms, says that she plans to continue her advocacy for the young people of America.

“Kids are our future, and education and health are the most important things for the next generation,” said Obama. “I have no stance at all on foreign policy, taxes, abortion, religion, or literally anything else. My platform is the children, and between that and my name, I think I have a great shot of becoming the Democratic nominee, and our next president.”

"https://empirenews.net/president-trump-set-to-legalize-marijuana-on-a-federal-level/"/President Trump Set To Legalize Marijuana on a Federal Level/"0

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump announced earlier this morning via Twitter that he would be legalizing marijuana on a federal level, which would automatically lift restrictions in every state, even those that have yet to set up legalization and retail options.

“At this point, there’s really no reason to continue classifying it as a Schedule 1 drug,” tweeted President Trump. “Everyone smokes it, or eats it in delicious little pastries and candies. Frankly, edibles are the only reason I can sleep at night myself. It’s been a long battle with wasted trillions of dollars, and I want it to stop.”

The President went on to say that the influx of tax revenue at the state and federal levels would be astronomical.

“Colorado can buy whatever they want, because it’s huge out there,” said Trump. “They can pay for education, healthcare, new roads, whatever. They can do that because of weed taxes. This is going to make the American people rich. Now we will be able to start building that wall!”

"https://empirenews.net/california-passes-law-to-completely-ban-cigarette-sales/"/California Passes Law to Completely Ban Cigarette Sales/"0

SACRAMENTO, California –

Lawmakers in California have passed a new law through the House that will completely abolish the sale of cigarettes throughout the state, according to reports. The new regulation, which will cost the state billions in tax revenue, will supposedly save upwards of 2 million lives per year.

“We have known forever that smoking is stupid shit, so why are we still selling cigarettes? Why is this still a thing?” said Representative John Lyman – D, California. “There is absolutely no reason to smoke. None. It doesn’t have a single actual benefit. It’s not like smoking weed, which, let’s face it, is awesome. Banning the sale will save lives, and help children not pick up the habit.”

The law will not go into effect until January of 2020, but Lyman says he hopes that many stores stop selling before then.

“I doubt they will, but it really is something we’re hoping the public helps us with,” said Lyman. “I mean shit, this isn’t Alabama. We’re a lot more sophisticated here.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

In a shocking move, Michelle Obama says she is ready to begin campaigning for a shot at the White House in 2020. The announcement comes after several months of speculation, but with Michelle always saying it wasn’t going to happen. The news also includes a shocking running mate – Michelle’s husband, former President Barack Obama.

“We had to look into the legalities a lot, because we were not 100% sure it could happen, but it turns out, everything is in order,” said Michelle Obama in a statement. “Barack finished his two terms as elected President, but would be allowed to serve two more terms as Vice President, were he able to get elected with a running mate who is eligible for the office. I believe I’m more than qualified for the job.”

When questioned about the issue, though, that if something were to happen to her after election, Barack would become President for a third term, Michelle smiled slyly.

“Yes, well…you do never know what the future holds,” she said.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump says he is beginning the preparations for deporting his wife, Melania, back to “whatever third world shithole she comes from,” according to official White House documents.

According to reports, Melania and President Trump had a bitter argument in the middle of the Oval Office, although the stories differ as to what caused the argument in the first place, with most sources stating that President Trump dislikes being referred to be his wife as “President Cheeto.”

“Frankly, I think it’s a sweet term of endearment from a wife to her husband,” said one anonymous staffer. “He really is taking it the wrong way. Now, of course, when she refers to his penis as the President’s ‘little Cheeto Puff,’ that might be crossing a line. But still – they’re married, you’re supposed to work these things out.”

President Trump said that he has been married enough times in his life, that “ditching one more won’t make much of a dent” in his life.

"https://empirenews.net/jeffrey-epstein-spotted-alive-and-well-in-puerto-vallarta-mexico/"/Jeffrey Epstein Spotted Alive and Well in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico/"0

PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico

Jeffrey Epstein, the man once thought capable of bringing down multiple governments with insider information about his immense pedophila ring and sex island, was reportedly seen alive in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico early this morning. A tourist visiting the area from Atlanta said they recognized him immediately.

“I was kind of shook, it was like seeing a ghost,” said the tourist, who wished to remain anonymous. “His murder – er, I mean, his suicide – was pretty much the biggest story of 2019 before it got swept away by the media. I’ve seen the guy’s face so many times on the news and on social media in memes, there’s no way I was mistaken.”

Another reported sighting of Epstein came only 3 hours later, and police were notified.

“Honestly, you’d think after they faked his death, he’d go somewhere a little more remote than a resort in Mexico,” said Carl Richards, who is vacationing in the area while going through a bitter divorce. “I came down here to relax and stop thinking about my bitch ex-wife, but now I think it’s time to go. If Epstein is here, and this news is breaking out, it won’t be long before the place is overrun with paparazzi.”

A single photo was taken by the anonymous person who first viewed Epstein as he exited a Puerto Vallarta hotel.

“I wanted to get closer, but I didn’t want to spook him,” said the source. “The picture is horrible, but I ended up walking right past him. It’s definitely Epstein.”

"https://empirenews.net/breaking-president-trump-arrested-leaving-trump-tower-in-new-york/"/BREAKING: President Trump Arrested Leaving Trump Tower in New York/"0

NEW YORK CITY, NY –

President Trump was arrested by the NYC Police Department while exiting his former residence at Trump Tower on Sunday morning, according to reports from the Associated Press.

Police Chief Mario Brann said that his officers were acting on an open warrant from 1998, when Trump allegedly struck a pedestrian while driving through the city, and left the scene. The pedestrian, whose name was not released, later died of their injuries.

“It is with great pleasure that I announce that we have taken President Donald Trump into custody for his role in the death of a young man in 1998,” said Chief Brann. “Mr. Trump is alleged to have killed the victim in a hit-and-run accident, for which he had never been charged. That changes today.”

Lawyers for President Trump say that the charges are “absolutely ridiculous” and “totally absurd.”

“There is no way that he was driving through the streets of New York and killed someone,” said Richard Moorehouse, a private attorney retained by the president. “President Trump cannot drive. The guy can barely navigate a golf course in a golf cart, you think he has ever learned to drive an actual car? He’s a total moron. Nobody would let him behind the wheel. If this accident occurred as they say, then we attest that Mr. Trump had a driver at the time, and he is not guilty of anything.”

“I’ve heard of people pleading insanity, but I’ve never heard of anyone pleading total idiocy to get out of a crime before,” said Chief Brann. “I am intrigued to see how this plays out. Either way, this gives everyone a break from Trump’s stupid goddamn tweets for a few hours.”

During NPR’s “All Things Considered” on Friday, Pelosi also called President Donald Trump “cowardly” for chosing not to wear a mask.

Breitbart reports: When asked if she agrees with about Biden making masks mandatory, Pelosi said, “Absolutely. In fact, the reason the CDC hasn’t made it mandatory is because they don’t want to embarrass the president, or insult the president, whatever it is, offend the president. They said they recommend it they didn’t require it.”

She continued, “The president saying this is a hoax, that it magically disappears and not wearing a mask himself as an example to the country, how cowardly is that?”

She added, “I totally agree with Joe Biden. As long as we’re faced with this crisis, masks should be mandatory.

Social media users have blasted the move comparing the ‘Orwellian’ police watch towers to something out of a ‘dystopian’ novel.

RT reports: Luke Johnson, a British entrepreneur, shared a picture of the new installations on Friday, raising eyebrows among Brits who questioned whether it was an appropriate way to spend taxpayer money. Many denounced the new street features as a “stupid waste” of resources.

This is the latest lockdown lunacy from govt: police patrol towers on Oxford St pavement – enforcing 2m distancing. Dystopian overreach and waste of taxpayer money. No wonder citizens have no respect for authorities. pic.twitter.com/yMNrsiYABw — Luke Johnson (@LukeJohnsonRCP) June 26, 2020

Many also pointed out that the “two-meter rule” is guidance, not an actual law, making the decision to have police monitor citizens’ behavior especially debatable.

Others complained that the watchtowers were something more likely to be seen in an authoritarian state like North Korea.

The towers were also branded as “dystopian” and “Orwellian,” with one user dubbing them “Covid-1984” towers.

The decision to install the watchpoints comes as London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced £110mn in police cuts, which left one Twitter user wondering how authorities still had “enough money to turn London into a concentration camp.”"/['Niamh Harris']/2020-06-27 14:59:26+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Covid-1984-watch-police-towers-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg"
"https://newspunch.com/muellers-star-witness-george-nader-sentenced-prison-child-sex-crimes/"/Mueller’s Star Witness George Nader Sentenced to Prison for Child Sex Crimes/"George Nader, a Lebanese American businessman who was a key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison on sickening child sex charges.

George Nader pleaded guilty in January to bringing a 14-year-old boy from the Czech Republic to the U.S. 20 years ago to engage in sexual activity. He also acknowledged possessing child pornography.

On Friday, a federal judge in Virginia sentenced Nader, 61, to 10 years in prison — the absolute minimum he could receive for his charges!

Time report: Nader’s name appears more than 100 times in the Mueller report. It details Nader’s efforts to serve as liaison between Russians and members of President Donald Trump’s transition team.

In the 1990s, Nader served as a broker to facilitate the release of American hostages held in the Middle East.

The convictions carried a 10-year mandatory minimum. The judge could have imposed a longer term, though prosecutors also recommended a 10-year sentence.

Nader also agreed to pay $150,000 in restitution to the Czech boy he abused, who is now an adult and testified at Friday’s sentencing hearing in U.S. District Court in Alexandria by phone.

“George destroyed practically my entire life, and I am trying to put it back together piece by piece,” he said through a translator.

Nader’s interest in children and his status as a behind-the-scenes power player both extend back decades. And there’s at least some indication that the latter shielded him from the consequences of the former.

Almost 30 years ago, Nader was caught by customs officials transporting two films, hidden in candy tins, of minor boys into the U.S. He received a six-month sentence, a term that prosecutors in the current case acknowledge is “far below what would be expected of such a crime today.”

Later, in 2003, Nader sentenced to a 1-year prison term in the Czech Republic after being convicted there on 10 counts of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to a one-year prison term in 2003.

Prosecutors say the abused boys were largely child prostitutes. The 14-year-old boy brought to the U.S. also alleged he was victimized by Nader int he Czech case, though Nader’s lawyers say he wasn’t convicted there. The two sides dispute the extent of abuse inflicted on the boy in the U.S. but Nader has admitted to one sex act.

Nader “used his contacts and his wealth to accomplish” bringing the Czech boy into the U.S., prosecutor Jay Prabhu wrote."/['Baxter Dmitry']/2020-06-27 13:52:19+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nader.jpg.optimal.jpg"
"https://newspunch.com/bill-gates-lashes-out-america-rejecting-globalism-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/"/Bill Gates Lashes Out at America for Rejecting Globalism Amid Coronavirus Pandemic/"Bill Gates has lashed out at America for rejecting globalism amid the coronavirus crisis, accusing the US government of “turning inward” by refusing to cooperate with the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union and China during the pandemic.

During a Forbes philanthropy summit, Microsoft founder Gates bitterly attacked the Trump administration’s decisions in recent months, claiming that by putting the American people first, the US has created a “vacuum” in world leadership.

Gates accused the administration of being more concerned with “trying to cast blame” for the spread of the virus.

The Microsoft co-founder added that he believes “rationality will reappear from someone” and the US will rejoin the globalist efforts of the WHO.

President Donald Trump recently withdrew US funding from the WHO over concerns about the UN health organization’s relationship with the ruling Communist Party of China.

Melinda Gates also spoke out in support of Bill’s global health work, later adding that when a vaccine is available, black Americans should be among the first to receive it.

“One of the reasons we are so involved in this is that you don’t want the first vaccines to go to the highest-bidding countries,” Melinda explained.

“There are 60 million healthcare workers [around the world].

“They deserve to get the vaccine first, they’re the ones dealing with this on the front lines, trying to keep us all safe.

“And then you have to start to tier from there, based on the countries and the populations.

“Here in the United States, it’s going to be black people who really should get it first and many indigenous people, as well as people with underlying symptoms, and then elderly people.”

The couple was speaking on June 19 at the Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy that was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic.

“Usually, the United States plays a role in global problem-solving, so rather than withdrawing from WHO, they’d be involved, collaborating with other countries, not just trying to cast blame,” Bill told the summit.

“It’s a tricky situation, where the U.S. sort of turned inward on this one.

"https://newspunch.com/biden-says-he-would-use-federal-power-to-force-americans-into-wearing-masks-in-public/"/Biden Says He Would Use Federal Power To Force Americans Into Wearing Masks In Public/"Joe Biden has said that he would use federal power to make Americans wear face masks in public.

The Presumptive Democratic nominee said on Thursday, if elected president, he would make the wearing of masks mandatory.

“I would insist that everybody out in public be wearing that mask.” he said

The move would mark a significant intervention by the federal government and would also see considerable pushback from states.

Several sheriffs have said that making face masks compulsory is unconstitutional and unenforceable, with one going as far as actually urging residents to defy a statewide mandate by Gov. Jay Inslee.

Fox News reports: Biden made the comments in an interview with CBS affiliate KDKA, in which he spoke about what he thinks should be done to reopen the country from the coronavirus shutdown. He said that he wants to see greater use of masks.

“The one thing we do know, these masks make a gigantic difference. I would insist that everybody in public be wearing that mask,” he said. “Anyone to reopen, it would have to make sure that they walked into a business that had masks.”

The interviewer asked if he would use “federal leverage” to mandate mask-wearing,

“Yes, I would from an executive standpoint, yes I would,” he said, to which the interviewer asked if he would then be mandating mask-wearing.

“I would do everything possible to make it required the people had to wear masks in public,” Biden said.

A number of states require mask-wearing in public when social-distancing is not possible, while a number of others merely recommend Americans in their states wear masks.

The Centers for Disease Control, meanwhile, recommends wearing “cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations.”

But mask-wearing has been hotly debated in many parts of the country and among lawmakers. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., recently said that “everyone should just wear a damn mask.”

But President Trump has not been seen in public wearing a mask, and has dismissed suggestions he should wear one. He has also suggested they could be counterproductive.

“They put their finger on the mask, and they take them off, and then they start touching their eyes and touching their nose and their mouth,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week. “And then they don’t know how they caught it?”

Any federal mandate that people wear masks would likely stir significant opposition, considering that state mandates have proved controversial."/['Niamh Harris']/2020-06-27 13:30:53+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Joe-Biden-4.jpg.optimal.jpg"

“These thugs are delivering ultimatums to businesses & schools: Do as we say, or burn,” Owens continued.

In the past week, two Black Lives Matter co-founders have had their Marxist backgrounds exposed, adding weight to claims the group is a radical leftist organization trained to disrupt American society and promote a modern multicultural variety of Marxist ideology.

Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi’s links to Communist Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro have been exposed, and co-founder Patrisse Cullors admitted to being a “trained organizer” and “trained Marxist” in a resurfaced video.

Black Lives Matter is a Marxist movement disguised as racial unrest.

Hawk Newsome, a Black Lives Matter leader also issued an ominous threat on Fox News, threatening that “If this country doesn’t give us what we want, then we will burn down the system and replace it,” before warning that he could be “speaking literally.”

According to Candace Owens, the liberal media is manipulating African Americans and “trying to inspire a race war” in an election year.

Owens urged her African American compatriots to stop rioting and acting “like a trained chimpanzee every single time the media runs a story.“

“That’s how you have to be black? Listen to your psychological conditioning,” Owens said.

“If to be black, you can’t speak in proper English, or you’re “acting white.” Right? To be black, you instantly have to jump up like a ****** trained chimpanzee – excuse my language – like a trained chimpanzee every single time the media runs a story, and act angry, and riot, and talk about how pained you were to see this happen to black people, but keep your mouth shut, right, when it happens black-on-black because if you talk about the black-on-black crime, you’re a race traitor, right?”

Owens also suggested that African Americans can learn from the example set by Scottish people in the 17th century.

“Scottish people were severely behind the English people, just in terms of everything. And David Hume inspired and uplifted and challenged the Scottish people by saying if we want to get ahead, we have to learn English,” Owens said.

“In a matter of years, in a matter of decades, the Scottish people passed the English people in engineering, and in the sciences. And it’s because they challenged themselves to be better, and not to be worse. They didn’t pretend that somehow having a broken language, having broken-down families was a symbol of who we are.

Not missiles, but microbes. Now, part of the reason for this is that we’ve invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we’ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We’re not ready for the next epidemic.”"/['Niamh Harris']/2020-06-27 09:05:26+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bill-Gates-1-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg"

Jay Inslee which requires people to wear face masks in public.

“Don’t be a sheep,” Lewis County Sheriff Rob Snaza told a cheering, unmasked crowd adding that his deputies would NOT be enforcing the rder. it

The New York Post reports: He said people should break the coronavirus safety order during a speech in a church parking lot Tuesday, according to footage posted by a Daily Chronicle photographer.

“In case you guys didn’t hear, Gov. Inslee in his infinite wisdom has decided after over a hundred and some odd days that we should all wear face masks — inside and out,” Snaza declared into a bullhorn while wearing a police uniform and no face cover.

“Here’s what I say: Don’t be a sheep.”

Dozens of people gathered around him are then shown cheering, clapping and waving American flags.

The defiant pep rally came several hours after the Democratic governor ordered residents to wear masks both inside and outside — or face a $1,000 fine and up to 90 days in jail — to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Before the speech Tuesday, the crowd gathered at a billboard that reads “Oh no, a virus! Quick, Burn the Bill of Rights” next to Interstate 5 in Napavine. They had flocked to the sign to oppose a petition circulating to have it removed.

Klickitat County Sheriff Bob Songer also spoke out against the governor’s order, calling Inslee an “idiot” who is “overstepping his bounds [and] violating people’s constitutional rights,” according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.

"https://newspunch.com/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-overturn-obamacare/"/Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court To Overturn Obamacare/"The Trump administration on Thursday evening urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.

According to Government lawyers the act became invalid when the previous Republican-led Congress axed parts of it.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden blasted the move, saying President Trump had put millions of lives at risk during the coronavirus pandemic.

“If Donald Trump refuses to end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him” he said after previously claiming that over one third of the country had died from the virus.

BBC reports: Health care will be a key battleground in the November presidential election.

Some 20 million Americans could lose their health coverage if the court overturns the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was introduced by Donald Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.

The act’s popular provisions include banning insurers from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents’ health plans until age 26. Millions of low-income Americans were able to obtain insurance due to the act.

Mr Trump says the scheme costs too much and has promised a different plan to replace it, preserving some popular elements of the existing law but covering fewer people.

Under the act, millions of people in the United States must purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty.

But in 2017, Congress removed a key plank of the policy, eliminating the federal fine for those who did not sign up, known as the “individual mandate”.

In its filing to the Supreme Court late on Thursday, the justice department argued “the individual mandate is not severable from the rest of the act”.

As a result, it said, “the mandate is now unconstitutional as a result of Congress’s elimination… of the penalty for non-compliance”.

Mr Trump cannot rely on Congress to complete the dismantling of Obamacare because the Democrats took control of the lower house in 2019."/['Niamh Harris']/2020-06-26 16:29:00+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Supreme-Court-1200x630-cropped.png"

Several sheriffs have also said that making face masks compulsory is unconstitutional and unenforceable.

ABC news reports: As states continue to loosen restrictions, facial coverings have become a common requirement for employees, customers, or both. In almost every state, masks are required to some degree, as reflected by the movement #Masks4All.

This week, Palm Beach County in South Florida issued a countywide mask mandate. Facial coverings are now required in all businesses and government buildings, while using public transportation, and in public when social distancing is not possible. The emergency order noted that the county saw a “sharp increase” in positive COVID-19 cases in late May and June. The county has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Florida after Broward and Miami-Dade.

Palm Beach County commissioners unanimously passed the mandate on Tuesday, with one commissioner saying the majority of calls and emails she received were in favor of it, according to the Palm Beach Post. Still, the vote was preceded by protesters shouting “Freedom,” and dozens of local residents heatedly testified against mask-wearing during a more than three-hour public comment session.

“You do not have the authority to govern my body,” one said.

“You guys are overstepping your boundaries,” said another.

Several Florida counties, including Miami-Dade and Orange, have been sued for mandating masks. One lawyer told West Palm Beach ABC affiliate WPBF that there are plans to file suit this week against Palm Beach County.

A day after the Palm Beach County vote, demonstrators in Arizona gathered outside Scottsdale’s city hall to protest recent mask mandates from the city and its county, Maricopa. The Arizona county voted last Friday to require face coverings while in public due to increasing cases of COVID-19. According to the order, Maricopa County had 2,055 new cases on June 19, compared to 137 on June 1.

The protest was led by a local councilman, Guy Phillips, and some 200 people attended, according to the Arizona Republic.

Phillips addressed the crowd by saying, “I can’t breathe,” before taking his mask off and uttering, “Insanity.” He then went on to paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, saying, “Anyone who would give up his freedom for temporary safety deserves neither liberty nor safety.”

Phillips has since apologized for using the words “I can’t breathe,” which were spoken by George Floyd before he died at the hands of Minneapolis police last month."/['Niamh Harris']/2020-06-26 14:22:06+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/coronavirus-face-masks-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg"

Photos have emerged of Tomato and Maduro meeting in Harlem, New York, with the Black Lives Matter leader posing with a raised fist for the camera while Maduro, a vowed enemy of America, embraces her and smiles.

Patrisse Cullors, another Black Lives Matter co-founder, also confesses to being a “trained organizer” and “trained Marxist” in a resurfaced video, adding weight to claims the group is using “social justice” as a front for more nefarious goals.

AmericanThinker report: The mainstream media would have you think the riots and looting that have erupted across the country are just spontaneous explosions of pent-up anger over the callous killing of a black suspect, at the hands of a blue-city Minneapolis police officer.

Well, I’ve covered a lot of riots — from Indonesia to Argentina to Russia to East Timor to Thailand to Venezuela, plus domestic ones in Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco — as a journalist. The one thing that’s always come out in the aftermath is that none of these mass rioting and looting events was ever a simple spontaneous eruption. All big riot events are man-made.

If the press had any curiosity at all, it would look to where the current mayhem is coming from.

The one place that really shows evidence of instigation is the failed socialist state of Venezuela and its controlling agent, Cuba. In this case, it’s not just the similarities in the end result — the mass riots that engulfed much of South America’s conservative-led states last year are remarkably similar to what is happening now in the States. There’s actual evidence of collusion.

Here are some photos of Black Lives Matter founder Opal Tometi whooping it up with Venezuela’s socialist dictator in Harlem:

Maduro is a pariah. And these photos are recent. What kind of organization hangs out with a brutal leftist thug like Maduro who is utterly discredited worldwide? Only one that shares the same aims as Maduro.

Maduro has stated openly that he is all about raining revolution and mayhem on the U.S. Looks like he’s found a partner. And it’s worth noting that Maduro’s mentor state, Cuba, has not hesitated to use Harlem-based black grievance groups to enact terror.

In the early 1960s, Fidel Castro’s catspaw, Che Guevara, used black militant guerrilla groups in the U.S. to plot out an explosion under the subway below the Macy’s flagship department store on black Friday, the then-busiest shopping day of the year in what would have been the first 9/11. Only J. Edgar Hoover’s alert agents stopped it. No such luck with today’s wokester FBI. Interesting that the rioters seem to have finally laid Macy’s low this time.

There was also the BLM appearance in Venezuela, probably Caracas. Takes some connections to be posted to that country as an election “observer” at a time when no international organization would agree to go there. How far gone do you have to be to endorse a flamingly fraudulent election? Opal thought it was fine and was all in for trying to do Maduro the favor of trying to legitimize his dictatorship. Favors, for sure.

What kind of people hang around with Nicolás Maduro, who’s a global pariah, given the starvation and poverty foisted upon his hellhole nation, which, by the way, includes a lot of black people?

Based on the comments from the Latin Americans posting these tweets, the node of connection may have been Danny Glover. That’s the radical far left actor whom news reports said received millions from the Venezuelan regime to make movies about Venezuelan heroes such as Simon Bolivar — and as my Hollywood sources on the inside told me — somehow didn’t make them. Perhaps he never got the money. Or perhaps the money was for something else. It’s just eyebrow-raising, and he certainly hasn’t said anything. What’s known for sure is that unlike most Hollywood celebs, he hasn’t repudiated Nicolás Maduro or denounced what has happened to that benighted pariah state.

Think the Latin nexus to riots are far-fetched? That’s not the sentiment in Chile, where similar nationwide riots engulfed the prosperous South American nation last year after it had just elected a conservative, albeit weak, president, and talk was rife of Latin American intervention in Venezuela, given the millions of refugees that were flooding out and threatening to destabilize the neighboring countries.

According to this eye-opening report from Breitbart News:

Protests and violent riots throughout the United States, nominally expressing outrage over the death of Minnesota man George Floyd, attracted Latin American leftist iconography this week – not a coincidence given months of violent riots throughout South America, observers told Breitbart News. Autumn 2019 saw looting, burning, and assorted destructive acts in Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, and Chile, among other countries. Like the current situation in the United States, violence appeared to erupt nearly simultaneously throughout the continent and, like in America, many locals expressed frustration that the most violent acts appeared to be committed or paid for by foreign actors. Bolivia, Ecuador, and Chile all arrested foreigners, most tied to the socialist and communist regimes of Venezuela and Cuba, accused of fueling violence in the countries.

It’s also noteworthy that many of the arrests of violent rioters in Chile, as well as Columbia and Peru, where riots also happened, were of Venezuelan nationals.

And it’s even more noteworthy that Maduro and his drug-dealing henchman, Diosdado Cabello, have both vowed to rain riots onto the U.S. Get a load of this from Breitbart:

At the time, one of the most prominent leftists on the continent, Nicolás Maduro henchman and U.S.-sanctions drug trafficker Diosdado Cabello, used his Venezuelan state TV show to warn the United States would soon face similar violence. “What is happening in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, Honduras is just a little breeze, and what is coming is a Bolivarian hurricane,” he said, referring to the Venezuelan socialist ideology. “The Bolivarian breeze will reach the United States and it will have someone who governs for the people.” Cabello’s statement appeared to be a reference to the 2020 election at the time. His boss, Maduro, endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 election but did not endorse in 2020. An investigative report by Project Veritas revealed that staffers on Sanders’ campaign this year had plans for violence against Americans regardless of Sanders’ performance in the election.

Direct links with BLM. Indirect links with Antifa, via Bernie Sanders, who has yet to condemn the Venezuelan dictatorship, or even call it that.

As I noted last year in this piece here, Venezuela since its communist inception has held fomenting revolution all through the hemisphere as its foreign policy aim. The warning was made as early as 2001, at a conference I went to in New York.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) should face “arrest for treason” after he “illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement” that he read out in Congress in an attempt to frame the president.

For the second time in days, President Trump has accused a Democratic member of Congress of treason, escalating his attacks on those leading an impeachment inquiry against him based on a complaint lodged by a “whistleblower” with no first-hand knowledge of events.

On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Schiff should be “questioned at the highest level” for “treason.”

Trump suggested in a tweet Monday that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) should face “arrest for treason,” claiming Schiff “illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement.”

Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019

President Trump was referring to Schiff’s “analysis” of Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Schiff misrepresented the call as a gangster-like shakedown, with Trump blatantly threatening the Ukrainian president.

The U.S. Constitution defines treason as waging war on the U.S. or giving “aid and comfort” to American enemies. Punishment for the crime may include the death penalty.

During a House hearing Thursday, Schiff tried to ramp up criticism of President Trump portraying him as a mob boss.

“It reads like a classic organized crime shakedown,” Schiff said of Trump’s call. “Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates.”

He then parodied Trump’s call in wildly inaccurate terms.

“We’ve been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have, but you know what? I don’t see much reciprocity here,” Schiff said, supposedly “parodying” Trump’s demands to the Ukrainian leader. “I have a favor I want from you, though, and I’m gonna say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it.”

Schiff explained he was trying to make clear what the president “was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine.”

“This is, in some character, what the president was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine,” Schiff said. “It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.”

“When I saw him out in front of the helicopter waiting to go somewhere and talking endlessly and sweating and sweating and not even —I said, this guy is not even aware of what he’s—he should at least ask somebody for a handkerchief or something and dry himself off.

“There is something very strange about that,” De Niro said on CNN Sunday morning.

WATCH:

CNN “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter then asked De Niro if he thought President Trump is an actor playing a role or “performing.”

De Niro nodded slowly before saying that “in some ways I think he is… but in some ways these other pundits on Fox are too, because I can’t believe they would actually buy into this craziness.”

“This guy should not be president, period.”

Host Brian Stelter said, “When you say that, folks on Fox come after you. I remember the Tony’s when he got up there and cursed.”

De Niro shot back, “Fuck ’em. Fuck ’em.”

Stelter said in response, “This is cable, so it’s not an FCC violation, but it’s still a Sunday morning. I do wonder why you choose to go that way.”

De Niro said, “In this country where this guy is like a gangster. He’s come along, and he’s said things, done things we say over and over again. This is terrible. We’re in a terrible situation.

"https://newspunch.com/new-pipeline-protests-after-trump-revives-keystone-dakota-projects/"/New Pipeline Protests After Trump Revives Keystone, Dakota Projects/"Hundreds of protesters opposed to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines took to the streets of Washington on Tuesday night after President Trump signed executive orders clearing the way for the controversial projects to move forward.

Trump’s order to revive the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines has triggered outrage among environmentalists and native American activists.

Press TV reports:

The protesters were mostly from Native American tribes who have formed a movement against the projects.

“There’s a man sitting in that house right now who is not going to stand for anyone other than himself,” Eryn Wise, a member of the Jicarilla Apache Nation, told the gathering outside the White House.

“We’re not going away. Welcome to your fourth day!” chanted the others.

The protests signaled the return of a series of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , that began in the state of North Dakota last year and spread all across the country.

Led by the Standing Rock Sioux, more than 100 Native American tribes have warned that the four-state pipeline would destroy their sacred sites and contaminate their water resources.

The 1,100-mile (1,770-km) pipeline would be the first to transport crude oil from Bakken shale, a vast oil formation in North Dakota, to refineries in the US Gulf Coast.

The Keystone pipeline, which would bring Canadian crude from Alberta into the US Gulf, was rejected by former President Barack Obama in 2015, following seven years of protest by environmentalists.

During his presidential campaign, Trump said Obama reluctance to give the go-ahead to the projects was indicative of the Democratic Party’s anti-business attitudes.

After signing the orders before a crop of reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said the projects would put Americans back to work.

House Speaker Paul Ryan also hailed the move, saying the projects would “strengthen our nation’s energy supply and help keep energy costs low for American families.”

The protests, which saw heavy crackdown by police, ended last year after DAPL was brought to a halt on Obama’s order."/['Niamh Harris']/2017-01-25 19:22:48+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pipeline-protest-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg"

"https://newspunch.com/payday-loan-brokers-help-themselves-to-uk-savers-accounts-customers-outraged/"/Payday loan brokers help themselves to UK savers’ accounts, customers outraged/"Brokers linked to payday loan companies may be raiding the bank accounts of over 1 million Britons, with many being the poorest in society, the UK’s biggest banks have warned.

Natwest, one of the largest retail banking chains in Britain, said it was “inundated” with complaints from customers.

Victims claimed that brokerages, offering deals on payday loans – short term loans with very high fixed rates of interest – are extracting sums of £50 to £70 from savings accounts without informing customers first.

According to Natwest customers, the businesses are websites that offer to find payday loan deals online. However, buried in the small print is a tacit agreement that brokers can access the bank accounts at any time.

Natwest, who told the Guardian that they had received up to 640 complaints a month regarding payday brokerage websites, said the majority of customers affected were financially vulnerable, and in many cases were already severely overdrawn.

The brokerage websites have also been accused of sharing financial information with other businesses without consent, and charging an additional levy for its services on top of the huge rates of interest slapped onto standard payday loans, which can be more than 3,000 percent.

“We’ve seen large numbers of customers incurring charges they don’t expect when using a payday loan broker since July this year,” said Terry Lawson, head of fraud and chargeback operations at the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) group, which includes Natwest and Ulster Bank.

“Customers’ account or debit card details are gathered and sent on to up to 200 other brokers and lenders who charge them fees for a loan application,” he added.

The news comes as thousands of customers who took loans with controversial payday loan company Wonga are to have their debts written off, in an action expected to cost the legal loan shark more than £200mn.

The UK’s financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said Wonga did not do enough to vet customers and their ability to pay back the interest incurred on loans, which can be higher than 5,000 percent.

As a result, a large number of Wonga customers were forced to admit they were unable to pay the company back after taking out a short-term loan.

"https://newspunch.com/financial-analyst-us-economy-on-brink-of-inevitable-collapse/"/Financial Analyst: US Economy On Brink of “Inevitable” Collapse/"Todd Wood, a financial analyst and author of the book “Currency”, believes the US economy is on the verge of collapse. Wood’s interpretation of the current world financial situation leads him to the conclusion that Russia is gearing up to become the next great financial world power. Russia’s economy collapsed in December, as we reported in late 2014.

Sputnik News reports:

The fact that Russia bought another 30 tons of gold earlier this week, bringing its total gold reserves to 1,238 metric tons should make the United States worried, said Todd Wood, the author of the book “Currency” and a contributing writer at the Washington Times.

Wood claims that the current state of the US economy is troublesome, to say the least. While both Russia and China keep increasing their gold reserves, the United States has gathered an overwhelming sovereign debt due to foolish spending habits that will inevitably bring the US economy down, the author said.

Russia is now the fifth-largest holder of gold reserves, according to the IMF. Moscow is increasing its gold reserves to strengthen the value of its own currency, the ruble. The smart move, Wood argues, adding that Russia is “preparing for the day when the tables will turn” and the world will see the decline of the Western economic power.

Unlike the United States, that has foreign debt approaching to $20 trillion, Russia’s debt stood at $600 billion, as of January 1, 2015. This is 33 times less than that of the United States. Furthermore, US foreign debt keeps getting bigger and bigger; meanwhile, Russia managed to cut down its debt by 17 percent since last year.

Washington should be worried about this. Soon the US might wake up and find itself in a world, where it will be bankrupt, meanwhile Russia, which has a gold-backed currency, will then dictate the new rules of an economic realm.

“There will be serious, deadly consequences to our irresponsibility, which emanated from both party’s lack of financial discipline,” Wood said. “At some point the Federal Reserve will lose control of the bond market. Our fiat currency will only be worth the paper it is printed on. The top-heavy, Western, socialist, welfare-state societies will collapse under their own weight.”

The United States is broke. The only thing keeping the US economy afloat right now is the US Federal Reserve that intervened to keep interest rates artificially low, Wood said.

"https://newspunch.com/financial-analyst-us-economy-on-brink-of-inevitable-collapse/#respond"/Financial Analyst: US Economy On Brink of “Inevitable” Collapse/"Todd Wood, a financial analyst and author of the book “Currency”, believes the US economy is on the verge of collapse. Wood’s interpretation of the current world financial situation leads him to the conclusion that Russia is gearing up to become the next great financial world power. Russia’s economy collapsed in December, as we reported in late 2014.

Sputnik News reports:

The fact that Russia bought another 30 tons of gold earlier this week, bringing its total gold reserves to 1,238 metric tons should make the United States worried, said Todd Wood, the author of the book “Currency” and a contributing writer at the Washington Times.

Wood claims that the current state of the US economy is troublesome, to say the least. While both Russia and China keep increasing their gold reserves, the United States has gathered an overwhelming sovereign debt due to foolish spending habits that will inevitably bring the US economy down, the author said.

Russia is now the fifth-largest holder of gold reserves, according to the IMF. Moscow is increasing its gold reserves to strengthen the value of its own currency, the ruble. The smart move, Wood argues, adding that Russia is “preparing for the day when the tables will turn” and the world will see the decline of the Western economic power.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration say that the reclassification will take place nationwide on August 1, 2016, meaning that members of the public across America will all have access to medicinal marijuana before the end of the year.

Smobserved.com reports:

The DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA’s plan to legalize medicinal cannibis nationwide on August 1, 2016. When questioned by our reporter, the DEA lawyer felt compelled to admit the truth to him as well.

“Whatever the law may be in California, Arizona or Utah or any other State, because of Federal preemption this will have the effect of making THC products legal with a prescription, in all 50 states,” the DEA attorney told the Observer. Federal Preemption is a legal doctrine that where the US Government regulates a particular field, State and local laws are overridden and of no effect.

He explained that “there are five DEA schedules. Nothing on Schedule One is ever legal, and that is where Cannabis is today. Schedule Two drugs are available with a prescription.”

On Schedule Two, marijuana will join drugs like Percocet, Aderall, Oxycontin, Hydrocodone and other drugs that are legal, even common, with a prescription. There are also other drugs that are not on any schedules but that are illegal on a federal level, he said. Drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter.

He opined that the 135 medicinal cannabis clinic owners in Los Angeles will no doubt oppose this move by the Federal government, because the rule change will eliminate any reason for people to visit medical marijuana clinics. “In my opinion, CVS pharmacy, Rite-Aid and Walgreens will sell Schedule Two THC products similar to what users call “edibles,” but will not sell smokable weed because of the health risk smoking anything entails,” said the DEA lawyer.

The Los Angeles based DEA Attorney who spoke to us, asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the press about the matter. He speculated that this action will be taken in the closing days of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, so as to motivate the Democratic base to turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton, and other down ballot candidates. She will certainly not reverse this policy decision taken in the waning days of the Barack Obama administration, he said. But Donald Trump might.

“Marijuana enforcement is a big drain on DEA resources,” he said was another reason for the change, noting that a majority of the American public favor the legalization of marijuana for medical use.

Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is in favor of legalizing marijuana and in fact owns a business which peddles pot in New Mexico.

California will vote on November 7th, 2016, whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Because of Federal preemption, the DEA’s reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule Two drug, will have the legal effect of requiring a prescription in California–i.e., it will continue the status quo.

Since the Golden State legalized medical marijuana almost 20 years ago, Federal authorities have occasionally raided medical marijuana clinics here. They have forced major banks, like Bank of America, to close clinic bank accounts. The Feds have even seized real estate belonging to landlords who rent space to pot clinics.

"https://newspunch.com/the-secret-connection-between-the-plague-california-drought/"/The Secret Connection Between The Plague And California’s Drought/"We recently reported that the CDC are warning doctors in the U.S. to be on the lookout for cases of the plague.

So far, 11 victims in the United States have contracted the disease, leaving 3 dead.

New reports now suggest a connection between this outbreak of plague and the horrific California drought.

Breitbart.com explains: “It is unclear why the number of cases in 2015 is higher than usual,” the CDC reported.

Dr. Bruno Chomel, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told Fox News that California’s record drought may be playing a role in the increase in plague cases. Plague is often transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and rodents carrying those fleas may be scavenging for food near campgrounds as food options become scarce due to drought, Chomel told the outlet.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Amesh Adalja told Fox that Chomel’s rodent theory appears to check out.

“These cases are occurring in locations where we know that plague exists in the [rodent] population,” Adalja said.

When left untreated, the mortality rate for plague cases ranges between 66 to 93 percent, according to the CDC. However, antibiotics available today have reduced the mortality rate of the plague to approximately 16 percent.

The CDC urges people engaging in outdoor activities in areas where the plague is known to occur to wear long pants, use insect repellent and avoid contact with sick or dead animals.

FOXnews.com further explains the plague-drought connection theory: A number of factors — including the behavior of people or rodents, or even the California drought — could play a role in the cases of this bacterial infection.

While there haven’t been any studies looking to see if the California drought is affecting plague risk, past research has shown that weather can affect plague transmission, said Dr. Bruno Chomel, a professor at the University of California at Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine.

Chomel speculated that if the drought is limiting food options for rodents, the animals may be seeking food in camp grounds.

In addition, warmer temperatures are favorable for flea activity, and if there is an increase in the flea population, the insects may be looking for more hosts, Chomel said."/['Royce Christyn']/2015-08-27 03:47:24+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-26-at-11.45.49-PM.png"

Transport Minister Anthony Loke told Channel NewsAsia: “There is no conclusive evidence to point at Russia under the JIT (Joint Investigative Team) evidence”

Moscow has also rejected the JIT’s accusation, saying it was an attempt to “discredit Russia in the eyes of the international community”.

RT reports: Last week, the Dutch-led probe claimed that the missile that hit flight MH17 in 2014 and led to the jet crashing, came from a BUK missile system that belonged to a Russian military unit stationed in western Russia. The interim JIM probe results repeated almost one-year-old allegations made by activist group Bellingcat. Despite Moscow insisting that no Russian missile system ever crossed into the Ukraine, Netherlands and Australia were quick to declare Russia “responsible” for the deployment of a BUK missile system.

While the blame-game continues to build up momentum, several Dutch parties, including the Party for Freedom (PVV), Dutch Socialist Party, Forum for Democracy, and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), raised questions as to why Ukraine was not held responsible for what occurred over its territory.

On Thursday, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said that he could not “rule out anything” speaking about Kiev’s potential liability for the crash, but noted there was no “hard legal ground” for it.

Russian authorities have repeatedly highlighted the fact that Ukraine failed to close airspace, while the West continues to pin the blame on Moscow.

Moreover, Moscow has provided the investigators with untampered radar data, which “didn’t establish any aerial objects approaching the passenger Boeing from the western side,” according to Russian military.

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asking them to look at technology from the likes of Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others, citing the “always on” technology as being “worrisome”.

Yahoo Finance report:

EPIC fears the average consumer isn’t aware that some of these devices are actually spying on them by recording their conversations even when the device seems to be turned off. The privacy implications of these devices, which they believe infringe on individual rights, is profound.

The companies say the devices are only engaged in “conversation” when triggered by a “hotword” or a certain gesture. However, those designs can’t be counted on to always work as planned and could cause accidental recordings.

If you’re worried about your privacy, here’s a list from EPIC that can help you audit your chances of staying anonymous.

Google Chrome

The browser is reportedly able to remotely install code that allows the software to listen to users without their knowledge. The code was originally designed to support Chrome’s new “OK, Google” hotword detection, which activates a computer response when you talk to it. However, some users claim the code was installed and activated on their computers without them giving their permission.

Google responded to these complaints on its Chromium developer boards. “While we do download the hotword module on startup, we do not activate it unless you opt in to hotwording,” the company wrote. Some developers question this claim.

Samsung SmartTV

The Samsung SmartTV has a built-in microphone that is equipped with voice recognition technology that allows users to give verbal commands to the TV. In order for Samsung to convert your speech to text, the voice commands are sent over the Internet to a third-party for interpretation.

However, since the TV is “always on,” the microphone is recording every word you’re saying at all times. Even in its SmartTV privacy policy, Samsung acknowledges that all spoken words, including personal or other sensitive information, are sent unencrypted to the third party.

Nest Cam

This Internet-streaming home security camera is a product of Nest Labs, which is now owned by Google. The camera comes with a microphone and streams video and sound directly to a consumer’s smart phone in real time. With the Nest “Aware” app, Google can record and save up to 30 days of video and audio.

Using the recording, the camera has the ability to alert users when an “unusual sound” is detected. Nest has the capability of distinguishing between unknown or known voices, which is an important security feature. But privacy advocates are fearful because the company does not disclose how the technology works or how much information the company collects.

Canary Connect

Canary Connect is another company that develops Internet-connected home security systems. The security device can store audio and video recordings from inside a user’s home for 90 days and can be set to one of three modes — “armed,” “disarmed” and “privacy.” Unless the device is in “privacy” mode, it will automatically begin to record when triggered by motion.

Users have complained that there isn’t an easy way to determine what mode the device is in. In addition, the interface doesn’t notify consumers when it is switching modes.

Microsoft’s Kinect

Microsoft has installed its “always on” voice and motion recorder, called Kinect, in its Xbox videogame consoles. When users say the word “Xbox,” the Kinect tracks and records the users’ voice and hand gestures in order to follow commands. In order for the device to know when to turn on, the console monitors conversations at all times.

Amazon Echo

Amazon Echo, like other voice-activated computer programs, is triggered awake by the word “Alexa.” The device is constantly listening in on household conversations for the word, which then triggers the system to record and stream the recording to Amazon’s cloud for processing and storage. Amazon has not revealed what data the system collects and if it saves conversations or words said before “Alexa.” In addition, various companies are in the process of incorporating Alexa into their Internet-connected devices. Amazon has not revealed how much information it will have access to once these other companies begin to collect their own data.

Mattel’s “Hello Barbie”

A new high-tech Barbie has sparked a furious outcry from the advocacy group Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. Through a Wi-Fi connection and a built-in microphone, the new Barbie is able to hold conversations with a child. Critics, in addition to the privacy concerns, are worried that Mattel is exploiting the children and using them for financial gain because they can learn the child’s likes and dislikes. Mattel counters that there are safety precautions put in place and that the toy fills a niche for children who want to be able to speak with their Barbie."/['Sean Adl-Tabatabai']/2015-07-19 02:02:45+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/smart-technology-spying.jpg.optimal.jpg"

"https://newspunch.com/busted-video-prince-andrew-inside-pedo-jeffrey-epsteins-house-horrors/"/BUSTED: Video Shows Prince Andrew Inside Pedo Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘House of Horrors’/"Video evidence has emerged showing Prince Andrew inside pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in New York.

The footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, was filmed in 2010 – two years after Epstein was convicted of having sex with a minor and nine years before he was arrested for child sex trafficking.

The footage and pictures show Epstein walking out of the front door of his Manhattan home – which has been dubbed a ‘House of Horrors‘ by many – accompanied by a young blonde girl.

Later that day, the front door opens again and another young woman leaves, and the face of Prince Andrew can be seen as he says goodbye to her. He can be seen seen peering around the side of the door, checking to see if anybody has witnessed him, before promptly closing it.

Dailymail.co.uk reports: The Duke has vehemently denied claims by Epstein’s alleged ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts that she had sex with the Prince on three occasions, the first when she was 17 and once at the US millionaire’s now-notorious 40-room mansion at 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan, the setting of these pictures.

Her allegations, submitted to a court in 2014, were later thrown out by a judge who ordered them to be struck from the record as ‘immaterial and impertinent’.

Since Epstein’s suicide last weekend as he faced further child sex trafficking charges, Buckingham Palace has repeated its denial of wrongdoing by the Prince.

‘Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue. It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts,’ it said.

‘Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’

The Queen also made a public show of support by allowing Prince Andrew to sit next to her as they were driven to a church service near Balmoral last Sunday.

However, these images are sure to raise fresh questions about the 59-year-old’s judgment as they place him inside the private, inner sanctum of Epstein, who continued to abuse young girls even after a controversial 2008 plea deal that saw him serve just 13 months, much of it on day release.

‘The Prince looked entirely at ease in Epstein’s house,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday last night.

‘There were girls coming and going. One, who came out of the house with Epstein about an hour before Prince Andrew said goodbye to the brunette, was tiny and shivering.

‘It was a particularly cold New York December day. What I remember most is the constant procession of girls and women going to and from the house.

‘It was chilling to see. Everyone knew by that point that Epstein was a convicted paedophile, yet he was flaunting his lifestyle in plain sight.

‘When the Prince came to the door I was stunned. He looked totally at ease. He said a few words to the girl, who was very pretty, and then she walked off down the street in the direction of Central Park.

‘If I hadn’t known it was Prince Andrew, I would have thought he owned the place. He looked so comfortable and relaxed as he stood there at the door.

‘He didn’t appear to have a concern in the world as he smiled and waved goodbye to the girl.

‘It was only as the girl walked off that he glanced around the door frame, almost as if to check no one was watching.’

The video was taken less than 24 hours after the Prince was infamously photographed walking through Central Park with Epstein.

He had met the US businessman through Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell and a woman the FBI says is now of ‘renewed interest’ in its ongoing case into allegations made by scores of women that they were sexually abused by Epstein and his wealthy friends at homes in London, New Mexico, New York and the US Virgin Islands.

Ms Maxwell has repeatedly denied that she acted as a ‘madam’ for Epstein and has described Ms Roberts’s claims as ‘malicious lies’.

Epstein’s New York home was as weird and twisted as the man himself. The entry foyer where Prince Andrew stood to wave off the brunette was decorated, according to an account by writer Vicky Ward in Vanity Fair magazine, with ‘row upon row’ of individually framed artificial eyeballs – imported from England.

The video footage shows the initials ‘JE’ in raised brass letters on the wall next to the front door.

What is not seen is the heating element that Epstein had installed beneath the concrete pavement to melt the New York winter snow.

On a wall in the hall was a bizarre portrait of former US President Bill Clinton in red heels and the infamous stained blue dress worn by Monica Lewinsky when she performed a sex act on him.

Nearby hung a giant painting of Epstein inside a prison surrounded by barbed wire and gun-toting guards.

The disgraced financier reportedly said the artwork was ‘to remind me that I could go back to prison any time’.

A chandelier had a ‘life-size female doll hanging from it, and one woman who claims to have been assaulted by Epstein said a bathroom had prosthetic breasts on the wall ‘so he could play with the nipples as he took a bath’.

Dozens of photographs of Epstein with his famous friends, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and filmmaker Woody Allen, were on display in his study beside a life-size stuffed tiger and a stuffed grey poodle.

One can only wonder how Andrew missed the procession of women or the signs of Epstein’s sexual deviance.

Indeed, Epstein’s ‘pride and joy’ was a large ‘human chessboard’ at the bottom of the main staircase which had customised figurines modelled on his female ‘staff members wearing suggestive clothing’.

Then there was the life-size statue of a naked African warrior. Not to mention the ‘leather room’.

When the FBI raided the house after Epstein was arrested last month, it reportedly found ‘thousands’ of indecent images of under-age women on computer hard drives locked in his office safe.

Others have claimed that Epstein had photographs and videos of his famous friends ‘engaged in sex acts’ which have now been seized by the FBI – prompting conspiracy theories that Epstein was murdered despite official autopsy results released on Friday stating definitively that the cause of death was suicide.

The video obtained by The Mail on Sunday is particularly shocking for the fact that – even two years after his 2008 child sex conviction – Epstein was seemingly flaunting his penchant for young women in plain view and in the middle of one of the busiest cities in the world.

The footage begins just before 2.30pm on December 6, 2010, as two security men leave Epstein’s mansion and chat to another security man in a waiting Chrysler.

Epstein’s black Bentley arrives in the street about 20 minutes later, shortly before a delivery man from Le Gourmet delivers a parcel.

Shortly after 3.10pm, an unidentified young woman in a red ‘beanie’ hat leaves the house. She heads in the direction of East 66th Street, where Epstein owned a flat and where, according to some alleged victims, he ‘kept’ young Eastern European girls as virtual prisoners.

About 25 minutes later, an older, professional-looking woman with blonde hair leaves the house.

One minute later, at 3.35pm, Epstein, wearing a thick white fur-lined winter coat, leaves his property, followed by a young-looking girl dressed in a flimsy grey top. She appears to be carrying his glasses.

In a deeply troubling scene, the blonde-haired woman – who barely reaches Epstein’s shoulders – appears cold and shaking as she walks with the millionaire to his Bentley.

Epstein clambers into the back seat as the young woman stands on the street, seemingly being given instructions. An older passer-by glances at the incongruous-looking couple.

After around two minutes, the girl jogs back to the house when she stands on the front step and presses the doorbell, visibly shaking with cold.

It is opened by a professional-looking brunette woman closely resembling Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s former assistant whom several alleged victims have dubbed a ‘co-conspirator’ in Epstein’s crimes.

Kellen, who is now married to a US race-car driver called Brian Vickers, has never commented publicly about the Epstein case.

However, she appeared in court during a defamation suit brought by Ms Roberts against Ms Maxwell and ‘pleaded the Fifth’ when asked about her role in Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme.

In America, invoking the Fifth Amendment is a legal term which means you do not have to give evidence that might incriminate you.

At 4.30pm, the door opens and a pretty brunette emerges. She pauses and turns back to the house where Prince Andrew can be seen at the door.

The pair chat for a few seconds before the woman walks away, leaving Andrew to glance up the street before closing the door.

Forty minutes later, as the light begins to fade, another young-looking dark-haired woman arrives at the house."/['Sean Adl-Tabatabai']/2019-08-19 16:44:54+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/prince-andrew-epstein.jpg.optimal.jpg"

"https://newspunch.com/chinese-bullet-trains-whiz-past-each-other-at-840-kmh-setting-record/"/"Chinese Bullet Trains Whiz Past Each Other At 840 km/h, Setting Record"/"China has set a new world record for trains passing one another at speed.

Two Chinese bullet trains, each travelling at 420 km per hour along parallel tracks in opposite directions, successfully passed within 1.6 meters of each other during a test run in central China on Friday.

RT reports:

Two bullet trains were tested at the same time in an effort to prove the quality of China’s high speed trains.

The test took place in Zhengzhou, central China. The trains, known as Golden Phoenix and Dolphin Blue zipped past each other with only 1.6 meters of space between them.

Watch: China tests high-speed trains with passing speed of 420 kilometers pic.twitter.com/a2Go2Pyues — Press TV (@PressTV) July 15, 2016

The trains passing each other at speed was a crucial part of the testing phase, according to one of the officials involved in the project.

“When a train passes another train, its engine will bring a great pressure disturbance to impact the body of the latter, which will affect the fatigue strength of the train body and the pressure in and out of the train,” said Wang Yueming, chief researcher at China’s Academy of Railway Science.

“This will help us collect data about the air-tightness of the train body and the firmness of the connections of the installed components.”

Footage taken from inside one of the trains captures the extraordinary speed at which the futuristic trains passed each other.

China is home to the longest high-speed railway, but its rail modernization ambitions suffered a major setback following a serious accident five years ago.

In 2011, 40 people were killed and scores injured when two high speed trains collided on a viaduct in the southwest Chinese city of Wenzhou. A government inquiry into the incident found it was caused by a combination of design flaws and project mismanagement.

The fastest operational trains are in Japan, where the Maglev train set a new record in 2015 by hitting speeds of 603 km per hour."/['Edmondo Burr']/2016-07-16 19:15:38+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/135516052_14685811811921n-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg"

In an early-morning Tweetstorm, President Trump posted Louisiana Senator John Kennedy’s comments blasting the women as left-wing “wack jobs” who are “destroying the Democratic Party.”

I’m entitled to say that they’re Wack Jobs.” Louisiana Senator John Kennedy — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 17, 2019

Senator Kennedy claimed the group, which includes socialist New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Somali Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, think that America “is wicked in its origins” and that Americans are all “racist and evil.”

The Louisiana senator said the women are “entitled to their opinion” but he believes they are “left wing cranks” — stating that they are so stupid they are the sort of people who need to read the “directions on a shampoo bottle” and Americans should ignore them.

“I’m appalled that so many of our Presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to try to agree with the four horsewomen of the apocalypse,” Kennedy added.

Trump tweeted the comments in apparent agreement with Kennedy amid accusations from the congresswomen that he is “racist.” The four women have fiercely criticized the president over border security policies and a host of other issues, even appearing at times to aggravate some Democratic Party elders with their ferocity, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

In a separate Twitter tirade last weekend, Trump told the members of the so-called ‘squad’ to go back to the “totally broken and crime infested” countries from which they came. Only one of the women, however, was not born in the United States.

House Democrats tabled a resolution on Tuesday condemning Trump for the tweets against the freshman congresswomen, calling his remarks a “blatant racist attack.” Trump said during an event at the White House on Monday that he is not concerned by all the outrage, however, since “many people agree” with him.

Social media users have blasted the move comparing the ‘Orwellian’ police watch towers to something out of a ‘dystopian’ novel.

RT reports: Luke Johnson, a British entrepreneur, shared a picture of the new installations on Friday, raising eyebrows among Brits who questioned whether it was an appropriate way to spend taxpayer money. Many denounced the new street features as a “stupid waste” of resources.

Many also pointed out that the “two-meter rule” is guidance, not an actual law, making the decision to have police monitor citizens’ behavior especially debatable.

Others complained that the watchtowers were something more likely to be seen in an authoritarian state like North Korea.

The towers were also branded as “dystopian” and “Orwellian,” with one user dubbing them “Covid-1984” towers.

The decision to install the watchpoints comes as London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced £110mn in police cuts, which left one Twitter user wondering how authorities still had “enough money to turn London into a concentration camp.”"/['Niamh Harris']/2020-06-27 14:59:26+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Covid-1984-watch-police-towers-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg"

Captain Tony Grider, 41, of Campbellsville was hurt along with three other firefighters when an aerial ladder got too close to a power line as their department doused a university band with water.

Kyle Smith, the chief of Campbellsville Fire and Rescue, said Grider died at noon at University of Louisville hospital.

“His family would like to sincerely thank all of those who have been there for them following this tragic accident,” Smith said in a statement.

Grider and his three colleagues were injured on Aug. 21 when they were attempting to help students at Campbellsville University participate in the ice bucket challenge to raise funds to fight amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.

Grider and another firefighter, 22-year-old Simon Quinn, sustained electrocution injuries in the initial incident. Two other firefighters suffered lesser injuries coming to their aid, officials said.

Quinn was released from hospital earlier this week.

“These injuries were very severe and both firefighters have fought extremely hard to overcome them,” Smith said.

"https://newspunch.com/report-says-uk-nukes-can-be-hacked-by-cyber-terrorists/"/Report Says UK Nukes Can Be ‘Hacked’ By Cyber Terrorists/"An embarrassing new report has highlighted the poor security of Britain’s nuclear weapons. The study, commissioned by the European Leadership Network (ELN), highlights the fact that UK nukes could be hacked by cyber terrorists, allowing them to launch a missile from a submarine.

The study worryingly concludes that Britain’s nuclear weapons can never be fully protected against a cyber attack.

Presstv.ir reports:

According to the report, there is evidence hackers have sought to compromise radio communications used to send launch approval messages, in an attempt to attack the nuclear submarines.

“By far the biggest fear and worst-case scenario is that hackers somehow compromise or sabotage the submarine or the weapons it carries,” Andrew Futter, senior lecturer in international politics at the University of Leicester wrote in an article for the ELN.

“UK submarines receive regular radio transmissions from ashore that could theoretically be attacked, such as weather updates needed for targeting and the regular FamilyGram…This will almost certainly involve malware introduced during the procurement phase while the submarine/missiles/warheads are being built, or when the submarine is in port for maintenance, refurbishment and software updates,” Dr Futter added.

“Given that the UK is likely on the cusp of building the next generation of nuclear-armed submarines, this challenge, and guarding against threats to the supply chain and overall maintenance, is particularly relevant now,” he reiterated.

Earlier in January, leader of UK Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn called for nuclear “de-escalation” in the UK, saying nukes should not be carried on submarines.

Corbyn said the UK could keep its controversial Trident submarine fleet but without carrying nuclear warheads.

The opposition leader is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system.

Back in October, a report showed the overall costs for Britain to replace and maintain its controversial nuclear deterrent program could stand at around £167 billion ($256 billion) – a figure the critics say is far more than expected.

The Trident program was announced in July 1980. Since 1998, it has been the only British nuclear weapon system in service. Its stated purpose is to provide “the minimum effective nuclear deterrent as the ultimate means to deter the most extreme threat.”

Those opposed to the renewal of Trident say that the changing threats of global terrorism and climate change means that Britain does not need a hugely costly renewal of nuclear deterrents."/['Sean Adl-Tabatabai']/2016-02-06 23:45:37+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/UK-Nuclear-weapons-cyber-attack-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg"

"https://newspunch.com/brussels-100-billion-bill-eu-army/"/Brussels Slaps UK With €100 Billion Bill For EU Army/"Brussels has slapped the UK government with a staggering €100 billion bill in order to help them fund their EU army.

The European Union is demanding that member states, including the UK, spend over £86 billion, despite the fact that the UK has formerly chosen to leave the EU.

According to a report, “EU citizens expect more EU action in defence and security.” The report states that the EU intends to increase its national defence expenditure to two per cent of EU GDP – which equates to 100 billion euros by the end of the next decade.

Express.co.uk reports:

The EU is determined to make Britain pay for The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as negotiations get set to begin on Brexit, in which Brussels chiefs have warned Theresa May to expect a £50billion exit bill.

The defence report says that there is “need for deeper discussions on the future relation between the Union and the United Kingdom in CSDP matters, and in particular in the field of military capabilities, should the UK decide to trigger Article 50 TEU”.

Despite the huge spending demands, the EU admits at least one project in landlocked Mali in Africa is failing after three years due to lack of powers.

The report states: “European soldiers are currently prohibited from taking part in military operations as observers, which means that they cannot identify any problems that the units that have been trained may have, and that they are therefore unable to resolve any operational problems at a later stage.

“These units – both in Mali and in the Central African Republic – are being set up for combat operations, and whereas after three years without appropriate equipment and training, as is the case for EUTM Mali, they are nowhere near operational.

“Without the necessary armaments, training missions will only be carried out abroad if the government of the country concerned provides armaments and hardware to the units that they can then continue to use after their training is complete.”

Ukip defence spokesman Bill Etheridge hit out at the plans and said: “Since the declaration of St Malo was signed in 1998 to advance the creation of a Common Securirty and Defence policy an EU Army has been happening – regardless of what you call it.

“Former Commission President Romano Prodi called for an EU Army in 1999, saying it was ‘inevitable’. In the face of all these semantics, perhaps he put it best when he said: ‘When I was talking about a European Army, I was not joking.

“’If you do not want to call it a European Army, do not call it a European Army.

“’You can call it ‘Margaret’, you can call it ‘Mary-Anne’, you can find any name, but it is a joint effort for peace-keeping missions – the first time you have a joint, not bilateral, effort at European level.’

“The Lisbon Treaty we signed up to put this on the statue books.

“It is happening and pretending it isn’t or that we haven’t contributed financially or diplomatically won’t change that.

“The UK taxpayer must not pay one penny piece into funding EU battlegroups: the priority for us is to build up our own weakened military and reverse the chronic underfunding of previous governments.”

Mr Etheridge added the Government “must rule out any money from the UK being spent on an EU military, particularly when we have a recruitment and retention crisis in the UK Armed Forces and they are so short of cash they are even trying to cancel secure communications from loved ones to those serving abroad”.

The MEP said the UK “must have no operational role in any EU battlegroups and instead concentrate on meeting our NATO commitments”.

He added: ”Unlike the EU, which admits it has spent three years in Mali achieving nothing, NATO has bite.”

Mr Etheridge called on the Secretary of State for Defence to rule out any funding post Brexit and said there must be no “back door routes keeping us tied into any EU military projects”.

He added: “The British people voted against an EU military, despite being spun lies that it was not happening – they knew it was and they are vehemently opposed to it.”

The EU report further adds it is planning to remove an almost obsolete operation from Britain which was rolled out in 2008.

The project called Operation Atalanta is an initiative that was set up to tackle Somali pirates.

After Brexit the EU wants it removed from Britain stating: “New command arrangements need to be found with regard to the Northwood Operational Headquarters for Operation Atalanta.”

But the operation’s website reveals there are no current active situations, there have been no pirate disruptions for three years and that there are no hostages.

And the “countering piracy” initiative uses space in London to coordinate its strategy taking attention away from British naval matters.

Mr Etheridge said: ”MEPs probably think they are playing hardball taking the Operational HQ for Atalanta out of Northwood but it’s a win for us and a lose for them.

“They have used our top class secure facilities probably without paying us any money for them and now we won’t have that burden.

“But the EU Navy’s own figures on Somali pirates tell the story: no vessels held by pirates, no hostages held and no operations against Somali pirates in 2017 so far.

“Far from a serious fighting force, this is more of a red herring: quite frankly you see more pirates captured in an episode of Poldark.”"/['Sean Adl-Tabatabai']/2017-03-26 19:38:55+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/EU-army-bill-UK.jpg.optimal.jpg"

Bush lied about WMD’s in Iraq and initiated the Iraq war under false pretenses.

If Donald Trump occupies the White House he says he will look into the events of 9/11 and why the Bush administration started the Iraq War to get rid of Saddam Hussein.

The decision to go to war in Iraq was the worst decision ever made in history, according to Donald Trump. The Donald wants to know why some Saudis were allowed to leave the country and go back to Saudi Arabia following the 9/11 attacks of 11 September 2001.

He believes that the hijackers were Saudis but does not understand why the George W. Bush administration went on to attack Iraq and its leader Saddam Hussein.

Sealed documents containing classified information would be looked at by a future Trump administration, and the past which led to all the present problems in the world will be investigated, according to the Republican front-runner and straight-talker.

Terrorism in the Middle East has not only become a danger to America, that now requires immediate attention and action, but is threatening to spread into Asia, Russia, Africa, and the Far East, with the ensuing chaos leading to a possible global confrontation between the super powers.

Meanwhile the so called Islamic State/ISIS ideology spreads and threatens the world like a cancer, mainly thanks to the extreme interpretation of Islam promoted by the so called Saudi 9/11 hijackers, the Al-Qaeda precursors to ISIS.

He added that Washington’s plan to create a Space Force could lead to catastrophe

The militarization of space is a way to disaster,” Viktor Bondarev, the head of the Russian Federation Council’s Defense and Security Committee told RIA news agency the day after the US President Donald Trump ordered the creation of a new branch of the US military tasked with operating in what he called “forbidden skies.”

RT reports: The senator warned that Washington could potentially violate international agreements regulating the demilitarization of space and thus put the international security in a grave danger. “There is a major risk that the Americans would commit grave violations in this field … if one takes into account what they do in other spheres,” Bondarev said.

“If the US withdraws from the 1967 agreement that bans deployment of nuclear weapons in space, [such a move] will be followed by a tough response not only from our state but from other states as well, which would be aimed at preserving international security,” he added.

The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, to which the US is a party, prohibits deployment of nuclear weapons as well as any other weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the Earth’s orbit. It also bans states from testing any weapons in outer space, or establishing military bases on the Moon and other celestial bodies.

Trump’s Monday speech notably mentioned a push to establish a “permanent presence” on the Moon, with an eye to a manned Mars mission, although he did not say if military would be involved. The US leader, however, called for establishing “dominance” in space, calling it a matter of national security.

The US has a history of unilaterally withdrawing from international treaties that regulate military activities. Back in 2002, US President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) Treaty, which had been one of the main pillars of the détente and held for nearly 30 years.

"https://newspunch.com/study-irish-dna-originated-in-middle-east-eastern-europe/"/Study: Irish DNA Originated In Middle East & Eastern Europe/"Scientists have discovered that Irish DNA originated in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

The DNA of ancient occupants of Ireland has given researchers a breakthrough clue into the history of the Celtic population.

The study was led by Queens University Belfast and Trinity College Dublin where scientists sequenced the first ancient human genomes from Ireland, shedding light on the genesis of Celtic populations.

Details of the work, by geneticists from Trinity College Dublin and archaeologists from Queen’s University Belfast are published in the journal PNAS.

The Guardian reports:

Scientists from Dublin and Belfast have looked deep into Ireland’s early history to discover a still-familiar pattern of migration: of stone age settlers with origins in the Fertile Crescent, and bronze age economic migrants who began a journey somewhere in eastern Europe.

The evidence has lain for more than 5,000 years in the bones of a woman farmer unearthed from a tomb in Ballynahatty, near Belfast, and in the remains of three men who lived between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago and were buried on Rathlin Island in County Antrim.

Scientists at Trinity College Dublin used a technique called whole-genome analysis to “read” not the unique characteristics of each individual, but a wider history of ancestral migration and settlement in the DNA from all four bodies.

They confirm a picture that has been emerging for decades from archaeological studies. Migrant communities did not compete with the original Irish. They became the Irish.

The ancestors of the Stone Age farmers began their journey in the Bible lands, where agriculture first began, and arrived in Ireland perhaps via the southern Mediterranean. They brought with them cattle, cereals, ceramics and a tendency to black hair and brown eyes.

These settlers were followed by people, initially from the Pontic steppe of southern Russia, who knew how to mine for copper and work with gold, and who carried the genetic variant for a blood disorder called haemochromatosis, a hereditary genetic condition so common in Ireland that it is sometimes called Celtic disease.

The DNA of ancient occupants of Ireland has given researchers a breakthrough clue into the history of the Celtic population.

The study was led by Queens University Belfast and Trinity College Dublin where scientists sequenced the first ancient human genomes from Ireland, shedding light on the genesis of Celtic populations.

Details of the work, by geneticists from Trinity College Dublin and archaeologists from Queen’s University Belfast are published in the journal PNAS.

The Guardian reports:

Scientists from Dublin and Belfast have looked deep into Ireland’s early history to discover a still-familiar pattern of migration: of stone age settlers with origins in the Fertile Crescent, and bronze age economic migrants who began a journey somewhere in eastern Europe.

The evidence has lain for more than 5,000 years in the bones of a woman farmer unearthed from a tomb in Ballynahatty, near Belfast, and in the remains of three men who lived between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago and were buried on Rathlin Island in County Antrim.

Scientists at Trinity College Dublin used a technique called whole-genome analysis to “read” not the unique characteristics of each individual, but a wider history of ancestral migration and settlement in the DNA from all four bodies.

They confirm a picture that has been emerging for decades from archaeological studies. Migrant communities did not compete with the original Irish. They became the Irish.

The ancestors of the Stone Age farmers began their journey in the Bible lands, where agriculture first began, and arrived in Ireland perhaps via the southern Mediterranean. They brought with them cattle, cereals, ceramics and a tendency to black hair and brown eyes.

These settlers were followed by people, initially from the Pontic steppe of southern Russia, who knew how to mine for copper and work with gold, and who carried the genetic variant for a blood disorder called haemochromatosis, a hereditary genetic condition so common in Ireland that it is sometimes called Celtic disease.

These people also brought with them the inherited variation that permits the digestion of milk in maturity – much of the world becomes intolerant to the milk sugar lactose after infancy – and they may even have brought the language that became what is now Irish. Some of them, too, had blue eyes.

“There was a great wave of genome change that swept into Europe from above the Black Sea into Bronze Age Europe and we now know it washed all the way to the shores of its most westerly island,” said Dan Bradley, professor of population genetics at Trinity College Dublin.

As Congress try to override Obama’s recent veto of legislation that would have allowed US citizens to sue Saudi Arabia over its role in orchestrating the Sept. 11 attacks, an organization representing Iraqi victims is threatening to sue and hold the American government accountable for its war crimes.

Sputniknews.com reports:

The Iraqi National Project has stated that the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which would allow 9/11 victims and families to sue Saudi Arabia over the nation’s role in the attacks, has opened a pathway for lawsuits against foreign governments.

The White House claims that the bill was vetoed because it would open the floodgates for other nations and organizations to sue the US, which is exactly what the Iraqi group wants to do.

“In light of the majority vote by the US Congress and Senate in support of the 9/11 bill removing the sovereign immunity rights of Saudi Arabia and other countries accused of being implicated in terrorism—and in spite of President Obama’s veto on September 23rd 2016—we hereby declare that if this bill is actually passed and becomes a law, then it constitutes a window of opportunity for millions of Iraqis who have lost their sons and daughters in military operations by US military forces and US contracted forces since the US invasion in 2003 to pursue compensation from the US government for what they have endured,” a letter published by the Iraqi National Project states, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

They cited US bombings of civilians and the well-documented torture that took place in Abu Ghraib.

“These US operations included bombings of civilians, arrests, torture [like in Abu Ghraib prison], and in numerous camps set up by the US forces across Iraq,” the letter continues. “There are also tens of thousands of maimed and handicapped Iraqis as a result of this injustice.” The group also asserts that all of those horrors were based on faulty US intelligence.

“The majority of the injustices were based on very sketchy information and very discriminatory methods with numerous omissions from US officials and ex-officials,” the letter reads. “Once the 9/11 bill becomes law, we will endeavor and assist on a strong effort towards the formation of special committees seated by top Iraqi lawyers and judges along with numerous international legal advisers.”

The Saudi government has repeatedly denied any involvement in the 2001 attacks which left nearly 3,000 people dead, but many have long suspected that the hijackers of four planes that crashed into targets in New York, Washington DC and rural Pennsylvania were backed by Riyadh.

The bill, which may become subject to the first presidential veto override during Obama’s term in office, has left many lawmakers in a tough spot, as they want to see justice for the victims of terror attacks, but are concerned with the precedent it sets.

“I worry about legal matters. I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedence. At the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court,” House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters.

A veto override requires two thirds of lawmakers to vote in favor of it, in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

Even key Democrats have said they will stand by the bill, despite the president’s objections, including Nancy Pelosi.

Addressing her top donors at a party Thursday night at New York’s Plaza hotel, Clinton blamed suspected Russian hacking and the email scandal case raised by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for her loss in the 2016 US presidential election.

She also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin meddled in the US election process because he had ‘”personal beef” against her.

Press TV reports:

The former US secretary of state made the comments in a meeting with her Democratic campaign donors in New York on Thursday, describing the release of a letter from FBI Director James Comey as regards potential mishandling of classified materials and Russian cyber attacks as two important factors in her loss to US President-elect Donald Trump.

“Swing-state voters made their decisions in the final days breaking against me because of the FBI letter from Director Comey,” Clinton said.

She argued that the release of those documents just eleven days before the November 8 election focused negative attention onto her campaign at a crucial time when voters were in doubt who to support.

The former presidential candidate also pointed out to an assessment report by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that the Russian administration was directly involved in cyber attacks designed to influence the last month’s US election.

“This is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation,” Clinton said.

During the meeting with her top donors, Clinton said that Russian President Vladimir Putin meddled in the US election process out of a ‘”personal beef” against her, referring to the year 2011, when then US secretary of state publicly challenged the integrity of the Russian parliamentary elections, and reportedly attempted to incite street protests against the government of Putin.

The American officials claimed that the Russian leader has never forgiven Clinton over these anti-Russian moves.

“Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,” Clinton said.

On November 8, Republican nominee Donald Trump stunned the political world and won the US presidency despite extreme unpopularity among minorities with 306 votes in the Electoral College, 36 more than he required to win the White House.

His Democratic rival, however, won the national popular vote by more than two million ballots in the November election.

"https://newspunch.com/study-processed-food-causes-same-addiction-as-hard-drugs/"/Study: Processed Food Causes Same Addiction As Hard Drugs/"A study by the University of Michigan proves what alternative health researchers have known all along – that highly processed foods are as addictive, if not more so, than hard drugs.

In Andrew Weil’s 1970’s book, ‘The Natural Mind’, he asserts that refined sugar triggers addictive behaviour in humans that mimic the behaviour of cocaine addicts.

Now in 2015 (over 40 years since the publication of that book) this new study says that “cheese really is crack“, and as the Los Angeles Times reported:

Pizza, unsurprisingly, came out on top of the most addictive food list. Besides being a basic food group for kids, college students and adults, there’s a scientific reason we all love pizza, and it has to do with the cheese.

Naturalnews.com reports:

The study found certain foods are addictive because of the way they are processed. The more processed and fatty the food, the more it was associated with addictive eating behaviors.

Even if you have never heard of Weil or this new study, you are likely already familiar with the addictive properties of food, especially gooey, fat, delicious cheese such as that found on top of pizzas, right? If not, perhaps you’re a soda pop junkie instead? We already know that the worst foods are the most addictive ones. It doesn’t take a fancy scientific study to tell us that.

Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. At least we now have somewhat of an excuse for obsessively stuffing our faces with Oreos, camembert or whatever our fix happens to be.

The conclusion of the report states:

The current study provides preliminary evidence that not all foods are equally implicated in addictive-like eating behavior, and highly processed foods, which may share characteristics with drugs of abuse (e.g. high dose, rapid rate of absorption) appear to be particularly associated with ‘food addiction.’

In other words, the highly processed foods work on our bodies in similar ways that addictive hard drugs do: they are absorbed into our bloodstreams quickly and in high doses, but do they actually give us a “rush” or a “high” similar to hard drugs?"/['Sean Adl-Tabatabai']/2015-11-02 20:18:26+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/food-addict-drug-addcit.jpg.optimal.jpg"

Foxx is running to return to her office as state’s attorney for Cook County, and it’s reported that she was aided by a political pac named the Illinois Justice & Public Safety PAC which helped her run a six-figure ad campaign.

The pac’s entire $2 million budget came from one of the many activist groups funded by Soros, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

Breitbart.com reports: The Soros funding came as part of the billionaire’s effort to put radical leftists into county attorney and prosecutor offices all across the country. And Foxx has been part of the Soros plan for years, already. She received $408,000 from the foreign billionaire when she first ran for her office in 2016.

Foxx was widely criticized for her controversial decision to drop charges of lying about a hate crime lodged against TV actor Jussie Smollett despite that the Chicago Police and a grand jury recommended that he be prosecuted. Even the city’s left-wing mayor vowed to hold the actor accountable for his actions.

Readers may recall last January when Smollett claimed that he was beaten by two white racists in MAGA hats who poured bleach on him and hung a noose around his neck after he left a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago during a freezing cold morning.

It was not long before the Chicago Police Dept. gathered enough evidence to show that the former Empire star was lying about the attack. Police collected evidence they say showed that Smollett had conspired with two brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, to buy all the supplies used in the “attack,” that he paid them thousands of dollars, and that he likely invented the whole story to get publicity.

George Soros is not the only super-rich leftist who supported Foxx. Free Beacon also noted that Foxx was the recipient of a lot of big dollar donations:

Donald Sussman, a billionaire hedge fund manager and major Democratic donor, has given $100,000 to Foxx’s campaign. Fred Eychaner, chairman of Newsweb Corporation, has provided $600,000. Michael Sacks, CEO of the Chicago-based Grosvenor Capital Management, gave $400,000. EMILY’s List, the SEIU, and the Real Justice PAC, a committee run by Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King, each sent hefty donations to Foxx’s campaign.

The man, whom police did not identify, accidentally toppled Dom Sebastiao’s statue after climbing up to its pedestal outside the ornate Rossio railway station in central Lisbon just before midnight on Tuesday.

He tried to flee the scene but police caught him. He will appear before a judge at a later date.

The child-sized statue of the sad-eyed, sword-wielding king stood in a niche between two horseshoe-shaped arches at the entrance to the station. Completed in 1890, the station is a protected monument.

Dom Sebastiao, who ruled between 1557 and 1578, is a tragic figure in Portuguese history, dying in battle at the age of 24 during a crusade of his own making in Morocco.

The man, whom police did not identify, accidentally toppled Dom Sebastiao’s statue after climbing up to its pedestal outside the ornate Rossio railway station in central Lisbon just before midnight on Tuesday.

He tried to flee the scene but police caught him. He will appear before a judge at a later date.

The child-sized statue of the sad-eyed, sword-wielding king stood in a niche between two horseshoe-shaped arches at the entrance to the station. Completed in 1890, the station is a protected monument.

Dom Sebastiao, who ruled between 1557 and 1578, is a tragic figure in Portuguese history, dying in battle at the age of 24 during a crusade of his own making in Morocco.

His body was never properly identified, giving rise to a legend that the king would one day return to claim his throne and save Portugal in times of trouble."/['Edmondo Burr']/2016-05-09 13:05:26+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ternyata-Kota-.jpg.optimal.jpg"

Doomsday fear mongers insist that Friday’s event is not just another natural astronomical event….

The Inquisitr reports:

According to the predictions of doom by end-time preachers, the Black Moon event on Friday, September 30, will bring about the apocalypse and global destruction.

But according to the astronomy website Accuweather, a Black Moon refers to the second new moon in a calendar month. It is a natural but rare lunar astronomical event that occurred last in March 2014 and occurs once every two and a half years or approximately 32 months.

In contrast, the term Blue Moon refers to the second full Moon in a calendar month.

During a Black Moon event, the Earth’s only natural satellite is completely invisible in the sky because the side facing the Earth is obscured completely in the shadows, away from sunlight.

But in the case of a Blue Moon, the side facing the Earth is bathed in light from the Sun.

However, doomsday fear mongers insist that Friday’s event is not just another natural astronomical event, as scientists think, but an event predicted by Jesus in the New Testament scriptures as a sign of the end of the world that comes after the fulfillment of the “ring of fire eclipse” prophecy that the Sun will go dark.

The website Signs of the End Times quotes the Gospel of Matthew 24:29.

“Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.”

The Gospel of Luke 21: 25-26 also talks about ominous signs in the heavens before the second coming of Jesus.

“And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”

According to conspiracy theorists, the first part of the Matthew prophecy that says the “Sun will be darkened,” was fulfilled on September 1, 2016, when the “ring of fire” solar eclipse occurred.

The “ring of fire” solar eclipse, which caused the Sun to be darkened over Africa, was caused by the Moon blocking sunlight from reaching the Earth.

The second part of the Matthew prophecy, which says that the “Moon shall not give her light,” will be fulfilled on Friday when the Black Moon event occurs, conspiracy theorists claim.

Conspiracy theorists also quote Acts 2:20.

“The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.”

The first part of the Book of Acts prophecy that says the “Sun will be turned to darkness,” according to doomsday conspiracy theorists, was fulfilled on September 1, 2016, while the second part of the prophecy that says the Moon will be turned to blood was fulfilled earlier in 2015.

The Inquisitr reported in April, 2015, that Christian conspiracy theorists, led by prominent and influential end-time preachers, such as Pastor Mark Blitz of El Shaddai Ministry in Tacoma, Washington, and Pastor John Hagee of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, warned that the total blood moon lunar eclipse that occurred on April 4, 2015, and another that occurred on September 28, were the third and fourth respectively of a series of successive total blood moon lunar eclipses (the Tetrad) that fulfilled biblical prophecies about the Moon turning to blood before the apocalypse at Jesus’s second coming.

Now, according to conspiracy theorists, the Black Moon prophecy will be fulfilled on Friday and would lead to the end of the world as predicted in Matthew 24:29.

“Those signs are letting us know that Jesus is soon coming,” a conspiracy theorist wrote on Facebook, according to Express. “We are approaching the end of our world and the end of life on Earth for all human beings. Every day, we have to come closer to our savior Jesus Christ. For none can escape for what is coming for the Earth.”

While doomsday preachers are busy spreading fear and panic, scientists have assured that Friday’s Black Moon will not cause the end of the world.

The Black Moon will occur at 8:11 p.m. EDT (5:11 p.m. Pacific Time) on September 30. It will occur in all parts of the U.S and South America, but only in parts of Western Europe and Western Africa.

It will not occur in the Eastern Hemisphere on Friday. But people living in the Eastern Hemisphere will have a chance to experience the Black Moon at the end of the October, around Halloween.

A Black Moon around Halloween is auspicious because in some Pagan traditions, such as in Wicca, it is the time for special rituals and magical spells.

The next Black Moon in the Western Hemisphere will occur in July 2019.

A less common use of the term Black Moon is about a situation that occurs only in February where there are no new moons in a month.

This is even rarer since it occurs only once every five to 10 years."/['Edmondo Burr']/2016-09-28 13:11:39+00:00/"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SMAK-6ca863ilolbyaipl99hb7aaoobhve6wv8qlxdkcuyca.jpg.optimal.jpg"

BATTLE FOR WORLD | June 25, 2020: If things could not get crazier during COVID-19, it just did. Former Congressman Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland over the years has voiced concerns about a surprised EMP attack on the United States to disable power grids across the country. Several voices in the US have been repeating the old-bag of drummed up rogue-nations in the way of US hegemony, that is China and Russia as possible candidates to attack the US with an EMP. They do not say what would possibly cause these so-called rogue nations to attack the US.

Dr. Peter Pry, the executive director of the Task Force of National and Homeland Security, who prior served as the Chief of Staff of the Congressional EMP Commission, a member of the Staff of the House Armed Services Committee, and also served at the CIA, and authored books about EMP. Dr. Pry wrote an op-ed for TheHill on June 18 titled “China’s surprise, years in the planning: An EMP attack”, and his article is so on time.

“China trying to do this [i.e. becoming an economic power] with active opposition from the U.S. makes the hurdle that much higher to jump over,” said Andrew Polk, co-founder of research firm Trivium China in Beijing. “But the U.S. has clearly lit a fire under China,” he said in a Bloomberg article, dated August 19, 2019. And the corona-virus influenza started to spread in the United States around that time and by October 2019 the Gates Foundation held a conference about a pandemic, and by January 2020 the whole COVID-19 drama started to materialize.

Is the COVID-19 drama not going according to plan against China? Has it fizzled out? Is the world going to see another information drama blitz with fingers pointing at China? (What’s trending? Go here .)

Just as we saw the corona-virus mysteriously breaks out, with countries in the West acting stupefied, with no pre-planning in place, etc., but the main aim, it appears, was to put the world’s economy in decommission mode. If the aim was to try and sabotage the world’s economy, then that act was directed against China , because China is pushing to become an economic power and if economies are locked down, there’s no one to sell to. After the lockdown eased, the world’s largest cargo ship from China arrived in Britain with much needed goods. The short lockdown did not work so the plot-planners are trying to scheme the world into another blame-drama.

Since Dr. Peter Pry introduction about an EMP attack is so timely, and his current position is with Homeland Security, is America and the same cast of characters prepping for another unexpected event? An EMP attack is basically another form of shutdown that will affect hospitals, homes, offices, hotels, supermarkets, convenient stores, personal phones/computers, transportation, work, etc. pushing most everything that requires electrical power into emergency mode of operation or none at all. This scenario is basically death!

The question is asked: Is there a Ruling Elite council that makes decisions privately, which are then implemented into the public, to bring about causal-events against the population?

If an EMP attack happens and you see on the news, repeated at ad nauseam, the same modus operandi as we saw with September 11, 2001/911, COVID-19, etc., then other operation is being implemented. And if this EMP attack does not produce the desired results, of pushing China back to a nonthreatening role, they will move on to the next planned event. And as always, calling the names of the same cast of rogue-characters. And there’s something important that the people must think about very carefully!!! – and that is: a lot of planning have been put into these blame-game events. Whomever is behind them, ultimate and singularity world power is their goal. They do not wish to see a multi-polar world. That means China and Russia…are being used as scapegoats.

For China to attack the United States with EMP, China will end up voiding a large market place for electronic goods in the US.

This sounds like desperation, a scorched Earth policy, throwing everything at China, hoping that something sticks to have China surrender, if not, keep throwing these engineered events…unto a nuclear war, World War Three, engulfs the entire planet. …[more]

After getting up this morning, grabbing a cup of coffee and scanning over the latest news, I decided to keep reading George Fitzhugh. This excerpt is from a book review he wrote called Superiority of Southern Races in which he took issue with Count de Gobineau:

“It was the misfortune of our ancestors in the Revolution of ’76 to believe, and to teach, that religion had nothing to do with government. The French Revolution, following close on its heels, shewed that it had all to do with it; and that government without religion was impracticable. Religion, as the word imports, is the tie that binds man to man, and gives vitality and stability to society. In its absence, men become demons, as in the Reign of Terror in France, and instead of loving and aiding one another go to murdering each other. Besides, he who believes not, or respects not, the government of God, will never believe in, respect or obey the government of man. The feeling of reverence for parents, and for men in authority above us, whether those holding authority be, as individuals, good or bad, is an emanation of the religious sentiment – part and parcel of religion itself.

The healthy mind rises in its feeling of reverence from parents to officials, from common officials to presidents and kings. But it cannot stop here; it seeks a cause for and author of this earthly series of subordinations, which secures to us all the blessings of life, and without which the world would be a pandemonium, and finds it only in the God of Heaven.

The infidel, whose diseased mind does not thus rise “from nature up to Nature’s God,” turns back upon society, asserts that all men are equal, disputes all human authority, and invokes anarchy and moral chaos. This is no fancy sketch – every page of history attests to its truth. Greece turned infidel in her higher ranks, became anarchical and feeble, and fell an easy prey to Alexander; Rome spurned and contemned her God, became demoralized, and found a race of cruel Caesars to avenge the cause of her slighted divinities. Bonaparte did for infidel, anarchical France what the Caesars had done for Rome.

Look at the North, where infidelity is talked in the streets, is daily diffused from a hundred presses, is heard in the lecture room and from the rostrum, and, worst of all, is preached on every Sabbath from her pulpits, and see how demoralized and feeble and poverty-stricken she has become! Not one human right is secure. The brutal mob reigns supreme; and for want of a Caesar or a Bonaparte good men, considerate men, religious men, men of property, would invest a monkey with the purple to escape the rule of the mob. Aye! and make a good bargain, too, for any form of despotism is preferable to anarchy. We respect, then, that they who believe not in God, will not believe in, respect of obey human authority. If our theory be not sufficiently sustained by our reasoning, the historical instances which we have cited will ever stand as stubborn and unanswerable facts.

Religion is the cornerstone of government; its whole fabric rests upon it. It needs not governmental aid, for it is stronger than government itself. Dynasties may pass away, republics and monarchies perish, all other human institutions be destroyed – but religion will last as long as man.

There is no infidelity in our Confederacy. Religion is universal. It binds us together, and makes us one patriotic and moral people. If the pockets of our soldiers slain in battle were searched, prayer books and hymn books would often be found; in none free-love epistles.”

Interesting theory.

Is there any truth to it?

I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there’s nothing that we can’t accomplish. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 27, 2020

After reading Colin Woodard’s new book Union and listening to the various interviews he is doing about the need for a national story to ground a revitalized vision of American civic nationalism, I decided to reread George Fitzhugh who disagreed with him on every point:

“We have not a solitary example in all of history to countenance the theories of our ancestors, that a people may be moral, or that government can exist where religion is not in some form or degree recognized by law. What latitude shall be allowed to men in the exercise and practice of religion, is a question for the people to determine when the occasion requires it. It is best not to lay down abstract principles to guide us in advance. Of all the applications of philosophy none have failed so signally as when it has been tried in matters of government. Philosophy will blow up any government that is founded on it. Religion, on the other hand, will sustain the governments that rest upon it. The French build governments on a priori doctrines of philosophy which explode as fast as built. The English gradually and experimentally form institutions, watch their operation, and deduce general laws from those operations.

That kind of philosophy, which neither attempts to create nor account for, is admissible and useful. An extensive knowledge of the history of the various moral philosophies that have succeeded each other in the world, is useful, but only useful because it warns us to avoid all philosophy in the practical affairs of life. If we would have our people moral, and our institutions permanent, we should gradually repudiate our political abstractions and adopt religious truths in their stead.

It is an unpopular theme to deny human progress and human improvement. We flatter ourselves that we are more enlightened as well as more moral than the ancients, yet we imitate them in all save the mechanic arts. …

Divest us of our Christian morality, and leave us to our moral philosophy, and we might dread the comparison with any era of the past. We have but one moral code, and that a selfish one; the ancients always had two, one of which was elevated, self-denying and unselfish. …

Now explore all the secrets of human hearts, all the recesses of history, and it will be found that religion is as much a matter of consciousness and involuntary belief as free agency or self existence. It is a stubborn fact in human nature. Statesmen cannot ignore its existence, and must provide for its exercise and enjoyment, else their institutions will vanish like chaff before the wind.”

“The immunity of a state from suit has long been held not to extend to actions against state officials for damages arising out of willful and negligent disregard of state laws.165 The reach of the rule is evident in Scheuer v. Rhodes,166 in which the Court held that plaintiffs were not barred by the Eleventh Amendment or other immunity doctrines from suing the governor and other officials of a state alleging that they deprived plaintiffs of federal rights under color of state law and seeking damages, when it was clear that plaintiffs were seeking to impose individual and personal liability on the officials. There was no “executive immunity” from suit, the Court held; rather, the immunity of state officials is qualified and varies according to the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the particular office and the circumstances existing at the time the challenged action was taken.”

Would a jury of peers agree their actions were negligent?

He was found lying on the ground not far from his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head after going for a walk last Monday.

He had dreams to further his studies at the London School of Economics. … “Somebody literally walked up to him and put a gun to the back of his head and shot him and we don’t know why,” said Smith.

Berkeley:

“Some of you are aware of the tragic death earlier this week of third-year UC Berkeley student Seth Smith. Seth was walking near his off-campus apartment on Dwight Way on Monday evening when he was shot and fatally wounded. Seth was 19 years old, majoring in economics, and was due to graduate in spring 2021. He came to UC Berkeley from Clarksburg, CA. … We realize this is a difficult time for those of you who knew Seth. It is important to know that individuals may express their grief differently and we need to respect the different ways people react and support each other in the days and weeks ahead. Many of you may have had a close relationship with Seth and are feeling a sense of loss and disbelief. Others, like many of us, are experiencing stress, grief and anxiety related to the coronavirus pandemic and the recent murders of George Floyd, Riah Milton, and other Black Americans.”

KTVU:

“BERKELEY, Calif. – The family of a Cal student is searching for answers after learning he had been shot and killed. 19-year-old Seth Smith was set to graduate from U.C. Berkeley next year. He was found lying on the ground not far from his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head after going for a walk last Monday. Loved ones of Smith describe the Sacramento-area native as brilliant and smart. He started Berkeley as a sophomore double majoring in history and economics. He had dreams to further his studies at the London School of Economics. … “Somebody literally walked up to him and put a gun to the back of his head and shot him and we don’t know why,” said Smith. Someone walking their dog found him bleeding around 11:15 p.m. He had been shot once. Neighbors said the shooting happened in front of a bus stop …”

Berkeley:

“Some of you are aware of the tragic death earlier this week of third-year UC Berkeley student Seth Smith. Seth was walking near his off-campus apartment on Dwight Way on Monday evening when he was shot and fatally wounded. Seth was 19 years old, majoring in economics, and was due to graduate in spring 2021. He came to UC Berkeley from Clarksburg, CA. … We realize this is a difficult time for those of you who knew Seth. It is important to know that individuals may express their grief differently and we need to respect the different ways people react and support each other in the days and weeks ahead. Many of you may have had a close relationship with Seth and are feeling a sense of loss and disbelief. Others, like many of us, are experiencing stress, grief and anxiety related to the coronavirus pandemic and the recent murders of George Floyd, Riah Milton, and other Black Americans.”

BATTLE FOR WORLD | June 25, 2020: If things could not get crazier during COVID-19, it just did. Former Congressman Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland over the years has voiced concerns about a surprised EMP attack on the United States to disable power grids across the country. Several voices in the US have been repeating the old-bag of drummed up rogue-nations in the way of US hegemony, that is China and Russia as possible candidates to attack the US with an EMP. They do not say what would possibly cause these so-called rogue nations to attack the US.

Dr. Peter Pry, the executive director of the Task Force of National and Homeland Security, who prior served as the Chief of Staff of the Congressional EMP Commission, a member of the Staff of the House Armed Services Committee, and also served at the CIA, and authored books about EMP. Dr. Pry wrote an op-ed for TheHill on June 18 titled “China’s surprise, years in the planning: An EMP attack”, and his article is so on time.

“China trying to do this [i.e. becoming an economic power] with active opposition from the U.S. makes the hurdle that much higher to jump over,” said Andrew Polk, co-founder of research firm Trivium China in Beijing. “But the U.S. has clearly lit a fire under China,” he said in a Bloomberg article, dated August 19, 2019. And the corona-virus influenza started to spread in the United States around that time and by October 2019 the Gates Foundation held a conference about a pandemic, and by January 2020 the whole COVID-19 drama started to materialize.

Is the COVID-19 drama not going according to plan against China? Has it fizzled out? Is the world going to see another information drama blitz with fingers pointing at China? (What’s trending? Go here .)

Just as we saw the corona-virus mysteriously breaks out, with countries in the West acting stupefied, with no pre-planning in place, etc., but the main aim, it appears, was to put the world’s economy in decommission mode. If the aim was to try and sabotage the world’s economy, then that act was directed against China , because China is pushing to become an economic power and if economies are locked down, there’s no one to sell to. After the lockdown eased, the world’s largest cargo ship from China arrived in Britain with much needed goods. The short lockdown did not work so the plot-planners are trying to scheme the world into another blame-drama.

Since Dr. Peter Pry introduction about an EMP attack is so timely, and his current position is with Homeland Security, is America and the same cast of characters prepping for another unexpected event? An EMP attack is basically another form of shutdown that will affect hospitals, homes, offices, hotels, supermarkets, convenient stores, personal phones/computers, transportation, work, etc. pushing most everything that requires electrical power into emergency mode of operation or none at all. This scenario is basically death!

The question is asked: Is there a Ruling Elite council that makes decisions privately, which are then implemented into the public, to bring about causal-events against the population?

If an EMP attack happens and you see on the news, repeated at ad nauseam, the same modus operandi as we saw with September 11, 2001/911, COVID-19, etc., then other operation is being implemented. And if this EMP attack does not produce the desired results, of pushing China back to a nonthreatening role, they will move on to the next planned event. And as always, calling the names of the same cast of rogue-characters. And there’s something important that the people must think about very carefully!!! – and that is: a lot of planning have been put into these blame-game events. Whomever is behind them, ultimate and singularity world power is their goal. They do not wish to see a multi-polar world. That means China and Russia…are being used as scapegoats.

For China to attack the United States with EMP, China will end up voiding a large market place for electronic goods in the US.

This sounds like desperation, a scorched Earth policy, throwing everything at China, hoping that something sticks to have China surrender, if not, keep throwing these engineered events…unto a nuclear war, World War Three, engulfs the entire planet. …[more]

“The immunity of a state from suit has long been held not to extend to actions against state officials for damages arising out of willful and negligent disregard of state laws.165 The reach of the rule is evident in Scheuer v. Rhodes,166 in which the Court held that plaintiffs were not barred by the Eleventh Amendment or other immunity doctrines from suing the governor and other officials of a state alleging that they deprived plaintiffs of federal rights under color of state law and seeking damages, when it was clear that plaintiffs were seeking to impose individual and personal liability on the officials. There was no “executive immunity” from suit, the Court held; rather, the immunity of state officials is qualified and varies according to the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the particular office and the circumstances existing at the time the challenged action was taken.”

Would a jury of peers agree their actions were negligent?

Would a jury of peers agree their actions were reckless?

“The immunity of a state from suit has long been held not to extend to actions against state officials for damages arising out of willful and negligent disregard of state laws.165 The reach of the rule is evident in Scheuer v. Rhodes,166 in which the Court held that plaintiffs were not barred by the Eleventh Amendment or other immunity doctrines from suing the governor and other officials of a state alleging that they deprived plaintiffs of federal rights under color of state law and seeking damages, when it was clear that plaintiffs were seeking to impose individual and personal liability on the officials. There was no “executive immunity” from suit, the Court held; rather, the immunity of state officials is qualified and varies according to the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the particular office and the circumstances existing at the time the challenged action was taken.”

Would a jury of peers agree their actions were negligent?

Would a jury of peers agree their actions were reckless?

It Will last Through 31 March 2025

You Will Get The Shot Or Be ….. FEMA Camped – Suicided

The Dead Folks In The Rest Homes Were All Given

“THE SHOT”

The Dead People On The Cruise Lines Were All Test Subjects For 5G Installation

Our Military Manuals Call 5G (4G LTE) an Area Denial System meant To Kill Intruders.

The Installation Will last Until 31 March 2025 World Wide

The governors requiring Masks now are knowingly part of this Deception and have already killed thousands with THE SHOT.

Good Luck getting President Trump to arrest these Murderers.
